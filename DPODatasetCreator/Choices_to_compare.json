    "one": "Synthesis note\n- Across drivers, the pattern is clear: price/mix and services growth offset equipment volume volatility. Power equipment benefits from slot scarcity and pricing; Wind remains selective with higher ASPs per turbine; Services provide the most durable growth via RPO conversion. Orders and RPO underpin multi‑year visibility. Geography tilts modestly toward the U.S. given onshore wind focus and hyperscaler-led grid demand. FX is a minor FY driver but remains a quarterly noise source.\n\nDriver 1 — Wind equipment volume and price/mix (units, GW, equipment revenue, ARPU)\n- Historical (annual)\n  - 2023: 2,225 turbines; 8.5 GW;

Quarterly history for certain drivers (e.g., 2024Q3–Q4) is not disclosed in context and marked “n/a.”\n- Methods\n  - All forecasts are calculations (Calc) derived from reported baselines and company narrative: sustained Power price/mix amid slot scarcity; Wind “limited-to-no” near‑term growth in onshore volume with higher ASPs; services mid‑single‑digit growth underwritten by RPO; orders > revenue sustaining RPO build.\n  - Where per‑unit quarterly detail is missing, quarterly forecasts are seasonality-aware extrapolations from H1’25 actuals and historical patterns (e.g., stronger Q4 installations).\n- Dependencies\n  - Execution of offshore backlog (Wind) and timing of large Power shipments can shift quarterly profiles materially; orders conversion and working capital phasing can also move between quarters.\n  - Electrification backlog guidance (≥$27b in 2025) supports services and equipment pull‑through but detailed quarterly geography and mix were not disclosed; geographic quarterly shares are proxied from annual mix.\n  - FX forecasts assume zero‑mean over a full year due to lack of company guidance; quarterly noise retained.\n- Currency and rounding\n  - All figures are in US dollars; rounding differences may occur. Historical figures reference explicit field tags; forecasts are clearly labeled as Calc.\n\nSources and key fields for history\n- Revenue and mix: Total revenues 2023Q1–Q4; 2024FY; Sales of equipment 2024FY; Sales of services 2023Q1–Q4; 2024FY.\n- Wind equipment: Sales (in units) | Wind turbines 2023Q1–Q4; 2024FY; 2025Q1–Q2; Sales (in units) | Wind turbines and repower(GW) 2023Q1–Q4; 2024FY; Equipment revenue | Wind GAAP 2024FY; Disaggregates total revenues | Equipment | Wind 2025Q1–Q2.\n- Power equipment: Sales (in units) | Gas turbines 2023Q1–Q4; 2024FY; 2025Q1–Q2; Sales (in units) | Gas turbines (GW) 2023Q1–Q4; 2024FY; Equipment revenue | Power GAAP 2024FY; Disaggregates total revenues | Equipment | Power 2025Q1–Q2.\n- Services by segment: 2023Q1–Q4; 2024FY; 2025Q1–Q2.\n- Orders/RPO: Total orders 2023FY; 2024FY; 2025Q1–Q2; Remaining performance obligations 2024Q4; 2025Q1; Power RPO 2024Q4; 2025Q1–Q2; Wind/Electrification backlog YE 2024 and 2025 guidance.\n- Geography: Revenue by geography 2024FY.\n- FX: Organic revenue by segment | Total revenues | Less: foreign currency effect 2023Q1–Q4; 2024FY; 2024Q3–2025Q2.",

No new drivers introduced.\n- Data availability: GE Vernova provides complete company and segment revenue (2013–) in GE-era filings but as a standalone, detailed annual driver histories prior to 2023 are limited. Where 2020–2022 were not disclosed in the dataset, “n/a” is used.\n- Units and GW: Annual 2023–2024 units and GW are from filings; select quarterly wind (2024Q3, Q4; 2025Q1, Q2) are from company materials; gas quarterly units are available for 2024Q1–Q2 and 2025Q1–Q2; other quarters are not consistently disclosed. Quarterly gaps are left as “n/a” rather than imputed.\n- Pricing proxies: Indicative “revenue per unit” uses reported equipment revenue and unit counts (annual) and is a proxy; GE does not publish ASPs. Quarterly ASPs are not disclosed.\n- Orders/backlog: Orders 2025 guided at ~ $50B; backlog up ≥$13B in 2025. Out-year orders/backlog are forecast with low‑ to mid‑single‑digit growth consistent with market expansion and capacity discipline.\n- FX: Forecast assumes neutral FX from 2026 onward given limited disclosed sensitivity vs larger mix/price/order drivers.\n- Wind trajectory: Consistent with management, we assume 2026 onshore revenue down ~10–15% vs 2025, reflected in wind units/GW forecasts, then a gradual recovery as policy/permit bottlenecks ease.\n- Alignment: Annual and quarterly forecasts are constructed to be a continuation of historical trends and to reconcile to management’s 2025 revenue commentary. Actuals may vary with project timing, large HVDC awards, and slot conversions.\n\nSources underpinning the figures (selected)\n- 2024FY total revenue ($34,935), equipment ($18,952), services ($15,983); 2023–2024 segment revenues; 2024Q3–Q4, 2025Q1–Q2 quarterly totals and splits by segment; quarterly services/equipment revenues; orders (2023, 2024; 2024Q3–Q4; 2025Q1–Q2); RPO ($119,023 at 2024Q4; $123,438 at 2025Q1).\n- Units/GW annual: Gas 2023 (91; 13.8 GW), 2024 (75; 11.9 GW). Wind 2023 (2,388; 9.3 GW), 2024 (1,778; 7.8 GW).\n- Quarterly units (where disclosed): Gas 2024Q1 (17; 2.3 GW), 2024Q2 (15; GW n/a), 2025Q1 (19; 3.0 GW), 2025Q2 (21; 5.2 GW). Wind 2024Q3 (515; 1.2 GW), 2024Q4 (670; 2.7 GW), 2025Q1 (276; 1.3 GW), 2025Q2 (351; 1.7 GW).\n- FX effects: 2024FY (-6), 2025Q1 (-129), 2025Q2 (+66), plus 2024Q3 (-8), 2024Q4 (-35).\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver these forecasts in a spreadsheet with formulas that tie each driver to total revenue and allow you to flex the assumptions (services growth, gas slot conversion cadence, wind policy unlock)."

    "one": "Synthesis note (context and cross-driver themes)\n- Electrification demand, gas services intensity, and selective wind equipment execution define the revenue mix. Backlog/RPO growth and pricing discipline are the connective tissue: Power services underpin resilience; Electrification is the fastest-growth vector; Wind equipment volumes remain selective with improving unit economics but offshore execution remains a watch item.\n- Macro tailwinds: the grid supercycle and firming capacity needs support sustained orders, while inflation’s roll-off moderates the nominal uplift.

where quarterly line items were not explicitly disclosed (e.g., some 2024 Q4 splits), I do not fabricate history. Forecasts are my estimates based on backlog/RPO momentum, disclosed unit/order trends, and management commentary on pricing/mix and capacity; all amounts are in US Dollars.\n- Forecast method by driver:\n  - Services: Assume sustained high-single-digit growth in 2025 (Power services +8% YoY), moderating to mid-single-digit through FY29, reflecting LTSA visibility and outage scope expansion.\n  - Equipment: Assume modest growth on Electrification capacity and gas equipment conversion, with Wind equipment recovering selectively; per-unit wind economics remain improved. Offshore contributions remain controlled until economics stabilize.\n  - Orders/RPO: Total orders grow mid-single digits beyond 2025 as Electrification remains in a seller’s market and Power benefits from HA/aero demand; RPO builds but growth decelerates as pricing tailwinds normalize and conversion accelerates.\n  - Segment mix: Electrification grows fastest, Power remains scale anchor with services > equipment, Wind modestly up with margin-first posture; equipment vs services share tilts gradually toward services.\n  - FX: Treated as a minor swing factor; 2025 modeled as a small headwind, then neutral thereafter.\n- Quarterly framing: “Last four quarters of history” are the latest disclosed quarters available in context (2024 Q3, 2024 Q4, 2025 Q1, 2025 Q2). Where a given driver’s quarterly split for a specific quarter was not disclosed, I explicitly note it rather than inferring.\n- Dependencies: Delivery cadence (especially offshore wind), Electrification factory cycle times and permitting, HA/aero slotting, and pricing under backlog drive variance. Any material policy or tariff shifts (IRA guidance, EU HVDC affordability) can re-phase orders and conversion. FX and commodity costs remain minor vs. services/RPO dynamics but can affect reported mix intra-year.\n- Limitations: GEV’s standalone historical beyond 2023–2024 is limited; I include as many years as available (last 2 FYs). Quarterly disclosures for certain splits (e.g., 2024 Q4 equipment/services) were not available in the provided context; forecasts reflect the most recent pattern and disclosed backlog/orders.",
    "two": "Synthesis note (context and cross-driver themes)\n- Backlog-led expansion: Record RPO (backlog) rose from $119.0B at YE 2024 to ~$135B by Q3 2025, with orders outpacing revenue. This underpins multi-quarter conversion and reduces forecast risk across drivers.\n- Services resilience: Installed-base services remain the most durable revenue engine, especially in Power (gas/steam services, upgrades, outage volume). Services growth continues even when equipment is lumpy.\n- Electrification supercycle: Grid equipment/software demand (HVDC, transformers, controls) is pushing high-teens to 30%+ growth spurts in select quarters; this lifts mix toward Electrification in 2025–2026.\n- Disciplined equipment mix: Power equipment is strong but supply-gated; Wind equipment is selective (offshore repriced, onshore focused). Mix/price have offset unit variability at times.\n- Macro catalysts: AI/data-center load growth, coal-to-gas switching, and policy (IRA/Europe) support orders and pricing; execution and permitting pace remain gating factors for quarterly phasing.\n\nAll figures in US Dollars.

Year-end RPO FY2025F: ~138,000\n\nAssumptions and caveats\n- Availability of history: GEV was separated in 2024; consistent pre-separation, company-level, segmental time series back to FY2020 are limited. I therefore present full audited annuals for FY2023–FY2024 and all available 2025 quarterlies; forecasts extend to FY2029.\n- Data sources and priority: All actuals are from company filings/press materials. Quarterly 2025 Q3 totals (revenue, services/equipment, segments), orders, and RPO are taken from GE Vernova’s Q3 2025 release/10-Q and webcast deck. Where filings disclose organic vs. GAAP, I use company-stated organic.\n- Forecast linkage to backlog: FY2025–FY2029 forecasts assume conversion of the reported backlog and sustained book-to-bill above 1x in 2025–2027, normalizing thereafter as capacity expands (especially in Electrification).\n- Services growth: Assumes continued outage volume, upgrades, and LTSA execution in Power; moderate growth in Electrification services; Wind services stabilizing as offshore execution de-risks.\n- Equipment phasing: Equipment remains lumpy, particularly in Wind. 2025 Q4 assumes normalization from a strong Q3; 2026 seasonality mirrors 2024–2025 cadence.\n- Pricing/organic growth: Assumes “price positive” persists near term, tapering gradually as supply tightness normalizes. Organic growth rates reflect mix (Electrification high, Power steady, Wind selective).\n- Wind risk: Offshore execution and project timing can shift quarterly revenue. 2025–2026 Wind forecasts remain conservative vs. 2024 until legacy exposures are fully worked through.\n- Macro/policy: Forecasts assume no material adverse policy reversals and steady North America/EU grid and gas demand; permitting/timing slippage is the key risk to quarterly conversion.\n- Currency: All values in US dollars; organic metrics are company-defined (FX/dispositions/acquisitions adjusted).\n\nIf you want these results exported to a spreadsheet with separate tabs for each driver (annual and quarterly), I can provide a downloadable file."

Units are US Dollars (millions) unless noted. Where fewer than five fiscal years of history exist in filings post-spin, I include all available.\n\nSynthesis note (brief)\n- Themes: Services remain the stabilizing, higher‑margin engine (Power installed base), Electrification equipment is the structural growth leg (grid/hyperscaler pull), and Wind is recovering with improving mix and repower. Gas “higher for longer” supports steady Power services; Electrification sustains double-digit equipment growth; Wind grows mid-single-digit in dollars on normalized pricing/mix.\n- Catalysts: Electrification backlog conversion and capacity throughput; Power services outage scope and upgrades; Wind execution and repower mix; FX is a quarterly noise factor but expected to be neutral over the multi‑year horizon.\n- Macro fit: Grid capex acceleration, firming gas capacity, and steady wind volumes (with policy execution) underpin a composite 5–8% TAM growth;

Wind $9,701 million; Electrification $7,550 million (10‑K | Segmental breakdown | Total by segment)\n\nAssumptions and caveats\n- Modeled vs reported: Every “Modeled” figure is derived from the following explicit assumptions; all “Reported” figures tie to the cited filed field names.\n- Equipment (annual): 2025 reflects 2025H1 actual cadence and H2 deliveries consistent with segment mix and orders; 2026–2029 at +4% per year, approximating a weighted TAM uplift (networks ~5%, wind ~3%, gas-flat) plus conversion discipline.\n- Services (annual): 2025 assumes H2 +5% YoY; 2026–2027 +6%, 2028–2029 +5% on LTSA execution and installed base growth.\n- Segments: Power FY25 H2 –2% YoY (capacity discipline); Wind FY25 H2 +0.5% (normalization); Electrification FY25 H2 +7% (grid demand). 2026–2029 growth: Power +3% p.a.; Wind +2% p.a.; Electrification +8/+7/+6/+6% (capacity ramp, secular demand).\n- Orders (annual): FY25 anchored at ≈$50B per management commentary (Transcript, Sep 2025). FY26–FY29 scale with IEA-modeled TAM growth (Section 6 of context): +4.2% to +4.3% p.a.\n- RPO (annual): RPOt ≈ RPOt-1 + Orders – Revenue (simplified; excludes FX, scope changes, and nonrevenue adjustments). This provides directional visibility; actual RPO will vary with contract timing and scope changes.\n- Quarterly seasonality: H2 splits use 2024 H2 seasonality by line (equipment, services, segments). 2026Q1/Q2 use YoY growth by line (equipment +4%, services +6%; Power +3%, Wind +2%, Electrification +8%).\n- FX: Treated as neutral at the annual level beyond 2024; quarterly forecasts include small mean-reversion placeholders. FX is inherently volatile; actuals can differ materially.\n- Geography: Only 2024 annual was disclosed by geography; quarterly geographic mix is not reported. Modeled U.S. share rises 1 ppt to 43% in 2025 and to 44% by 2026 as management noted a U.S. mix shift; thereafter held flat. Values are applied to modeled totals; actual regional mix can differ by project timing.\n- Scope limits: Historical annual data prior to FY 2023 are not fully available on a stand‑alone basis for GEV post‑spin; where data were unavailable, we limited history to filed periods and did not backfill.\n- Dependencies: Forecasts are sensitive to Wind order normalization, Electrification capacity/lead times, Power equipment slotting, policy/tariff outcomes (Wind), and rate environment effects on orders/bookings.\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver these drivers in a spreadsheet and add charts showing the quarterly and annual trajectories by driver, with reported vs modeled clearly distinguished."

    "one": "Synthesis note\n- Demand remains strongest where backlog and services attach are deepest: Power’s services annuity continues to lead (largest RPO, >60% of Power RPO in services), Electrification is converting a fast‑rising grid backlog at improving terms, and Wind is stabilizing with improving onshore/services and a declining offshore drag. \n- Near-term catalysts: data-center load (Power equipment and upgrades; Electrification transformers/switchgear/HVDC), U.S. IRA support for onshore wind and grid, and a gas new‑build upcycle with tight OEM/EPC capacity and premium slot pricing. \n- Key macro overlays: tariff/inflation pass‑throughs and European HVDC affordability assessments are moderating Electrification pricing momentum versus 2024, but price remains positive, with margin lift increasingly driven by execution/productivity. \n\nRevenue drivers and forecasts\nAll figures in USD millions unless stated. “Actual” = disclosed values;

No new drivers were introduced.\n- Data availability limits: GE Vernova’s standalone disclosure history is short (FY2023–FY2024 full years; latest quarters through 2025Q2 in the provided context). Earlier five-year histories are not available on a comparable standalone basis; we therefore provide “as many as available” (FY2023–FY2024) and detailed quarterlies for the last four quarters from disclosed and derived values.\n- Quarterly geography and some quarterly orders: Not fully disclosed; we refrain from inventing historical values. Where quarterly metrics were needed for forecasting, we clearly labeled modeled estimates.\n- Forecasting methodology: \n  - Power services: high-single-digit to mid-single-digit growth glide path tied to RPO growth and installed-base utilization/upgrades; quarterly Power revenue used as the proxy in the near term due to data granularity.\n  - Wind: FY2025 total down mid-single digits (management commentary), with equipment lower and services rising as fleet/service scope grows; gradual improvement FY2026+ as offshore legacy backlog is executed and onshore/services expand.\n  - Electrification equipment: mid-to-high teens in FY2025 per management, decelerating to low teens by FY2027–FY2029 as pricing tailwinds moderate and productivity/throughput drive margins.\n  - Orders/RPO: FY2025 orders ≈$50B (company commentary), RPO accretes in line with >1x book‑to‑bill and backlog margin improvement.\n  - Geography: U.S. outgrowth near term; International steady.\n  - FX: FY2025 modest net headwind given Q1 drag, largely neutral thereafter.\n- Currency: All figures in U.S. dollars.\n- Risks not fully modeled: tariff/inflation headwinds ($300–$400M est. 2025 net of mitigation), EU HVDC deferrals, EPC/permit gating for SRAs, offshore execution risks until Vineyard/Dogger milestones are closed. These could shift quarterly phasing and near-term margin/revenue conversion.\n- Reliance on official filings: Historical numeric facts and RPO/orders come from company filings and prepared remarks; where conflicts exist in third-party commentary, we prioritize official disclosures. Forecasts are analyst models grounded in those disclosures.",
    "two": "Synthesis note (brief)\n- The drivers work together as follows: services mix expansion and price discipline provide a stable, recurring base; Electrification revenue accelerates on record grid backlog and premium slot monetization; Power benefits from gas-turbine slot scarcity and strong services; Wind is recovering with disciplined onshore intake and offshore backlog run-down.

Measures chosen mirror how the company discloses and how each driver maps to revenue (e.g., Wind driver proxied by Wind total revenue; Electrification driver proxied by Electrification revenue).\n- Data availability: GE Vernova standalone has complete FY data from 2024 and derived 2023; earlier standalone fiscal years are not comparable and are omitted by design. Quarterly actuals through 2025Q3 are used where disclosed; otherwise implied from totals or official press tables.\n- FX: FX is modeled as modest and mean‑reverting. 2025 full‑year FX headwind reflects reported/indicated quarterly effects; FY2026+ assumed neutral for planning simplicity. FX can diverge materially.\n- Seasonal patterning: Quarterly forecasts preserve observed seasonality (Q4 strongest for services and grid; Q1 lowest), applying segment/driver‑specific YoY growth rates.\n- Electrification outlook: Assumes strong backlog conversion with decelerating growth from low‑20s in 2025 toward low‑teens by 2026 and high single‑digits by 2028–2029, consistent with capacity debottlenecking and tighter industry supply gradually easing.\n- Power outlook: Mid‑single‑digit growth sustained by services and disciplined equipment slotting; assumes gas additions ≥50–60 GW industry-wide with pricing discipline intact.\n- Wind outlook: 2026 down ~12% (midpoint of management color of −10–15% for onshore revenue vs 2025), then low‑single‑digit recovery as offshore backlog winds down and onshore services improve. No new offshore backlog assumed under current industry economics.\n- Orders/RPO: Book‑to‑bill modestly >1 in 2025, normalizing toward ~1.0 thereafter; RPO increases are indicative and depend on award timing (e.g., HVDC, synchronous condensers) and conversion cadence.\n- Guidance alignment: The FY2025 revenue aggregation implied by segment forecasts sits toward the upper end of the reaffirmed $36–$37B outlook; Q4 mix (especially Wind/Electrification timing) can swing the finish within the range.\n- All dollars are US Dollars.

    "one": "Synthesis note\n- Structural setup: Electrification is on the steepest part of its growth curve (RPO more than doubled 2023→2024), Power is in a durable up‑cycle with services anchoring stability, and Wind is stabilizing with onshore price/mix and services offsetting selective volume and offshore execution variability.\n- Mix and cadence: Consolidated growth near term is led by Electrification and Power; services outgrow equipment by a modest margin over the medium term, lifting mix quality. Wind volumes are flattish in 2025 with a gradual recovery from 2026 as orders normalize; ASPs continue to trend up on pricing discipline.\n- Backlog/visibility: Book-to-bill above 1x in 2023–2024 and rising RPO into 2025 underpin multi‑quarter visibility.

Quarterly RPO for 2025Q2 is approximated as the sum of disclosed segment RPOs (Power 79.1B, Electrification 27.5B, Wind 22.5B ≈ 129.1B).\n- Forecast framing:\n  - FY2025 company revenue anchored near ~$37B (management commentary that 2025 orders ~$50B vs ~$37B revenue). Equipment/services split extrapolated from 2025H1 actuals and typical H2 seasonality.\n  - Services growth mid-to-high single digits 2026–2029 on installed-base monetization; equipment growth reflects Electrification backlog conversion and “higher-for-longer” Gas, partly offset by Wind caution in 2026.\n  - Wind 2026 revenue modeled down ~10–15% vs 2025 (management commentary), stabilizing thereafter.\n  - Orders growth outpaces revenue near term; RPO builds in 2025 then grows steadily.\n- Quarterly geography: Not disclosed; forecasts apply annual mix; actuals could vary by project timing and region.\n- Segment eliminations: Small and variable; we show approximate eliminations to reconcile segment totals to company totals; these are directional.\n- Units (gas/wind): Shipment forecasts are directional to reflect mix and market color; actuals will depend on project timing. The topline forecasts are the binding view for the equipment driver.\n- Currency: All figures in U.S. dollars.\n- Uncertainty: Macro, policy, permitting, tariffs, and Wind competitive dynamics can shift phasing. Where explicit quarterly data are missing historically (e.g., geography), we avoid backfilling and state assumptions.\n\nThis forecast keeps driver naming consistent, aligns with the company’s historical patterns through 2025Q2, and projects a continuation supported by orders and RPO, Gas services annuity strength, and Electrification backlog conversion."

    "one": "Synthesis note\n- Demand picture: Power and Electrification are carrying the growth slope; Wind is stabilizing with onshore discipline and repower/services while offshore burn‑down continues. The multi‑year electrification/flex capacity upcycle, backlog depth, and price discipline underwrite visibility; tariffs and wind execution remain the main near‑term swing factors.\n- Backlog and pricing: Company RPO rose from ~$119.0B (YE24) to ~$128.7B (2025Q2), with equipment and services priced better than a year ago. Slot scarcity in gas turbines and grid equipment supports continued price/mix tailwinds into 2026–2027 as capacity ramps.\n- Forecast stance: Services continue mid‑single‑digit growth; Electrification high‑teens in 2025 then mid/high single‑digit; Gas equipment shipments step up through 2026–2027; Wind volumes bottom in 2025 and improve from 2026 on repower/services and selective onshore awards.

Where quarter detail wasn’t disclosed, we used clearly labeled derivations (e.g., FY minus known quarters) and showed “n/a” instead of inventing values.\n- Forecasting method: Backlog, disclosed orders/SRAs, mix/pricing commentary, and capacity plans anchor the slope. Wind 2025 reflects management’s mid‑single‑digit down organic revenue guide; gas equipment ramps through 2026–2027; Electrification moderates from 2025’s high‑teens.\n- Quarterly wind/gas allocations: For gas, 2024Q3–Q4 GW split is not disclosed; we provide the combined GW math and leave quarter splits “n/a.” Wind quarterly values use disclosed Q3/Q4 and half‑year arithmetic.\n- FX: We assume FX‑neutral for forecasts; actual quarterly prints can swing materially without changing the fundamental trajectory.\n- Policy/tariffs and execution: 2025 tariff headwind ($300–$400m, net of mitigations) embedded qualitatively; large HVDC/offshore execution and permitting remain key timing and margin variables, especially for Wind.\n- Currency: All figures in US dollars; GW/units as disclosed.\n\nSources frame\n- History includes: FY24 and 2025Q2 reported data and line items cited in company 10‑K/10‑Q, earnings materials and KPIs; FY23 is the sum of quarterly. Forecasts follow from those histories and management capacity/backlog commentary.",
    "two": "Synthesis note\n- Theme: Electrification-led growth, services resilience, and backlog visibility underpin the near-term trajectory while Wind equipment cadence remains lumpy during the industry reset. Data-center loads, firming needs (gas), and grid scarcity are reinforcing demand, with Electrification the steepest grower and Power services a steady annuity.\n- Conversion rhythm: Healthy book-to-bill (>1x) and a rising RPO support multi-quarter revenue conversion; quarterly free cash flow and margins can remain timing-sensitive.\n- Mix: Segment mix continues to tilt toward Electrification; services steadily expand across Power and Electrification.\n\nAll figures in US dollars. “FY” denotes fiscal year; “Q” denotes fiscal quarter.

    "one": "Synthesis note\n- Backlog-to-revenue conversion, services density, and grid slot scarcity are the cross‑driver themes. Electrification remains a seller’s market with rising backlog margins and long lead times; Power’s services annuity and premium equipment slots underpin visibility; Wind is mixed—U.S. onshore/repower resilient while offshore execution remains lumpy. Macro catalysts (AI/data‑center load growth, grid reliability mandates, and policy support) support sustained orders/RPO growth and mid‑cycle revenue conversion; FX is a minor annual factor with quarter-to-quarter noise.\n\nRevenue drivers and forecasts\nDriver 1 — Equipment volume conversion (company “Sales of equipment” dollars; Wind equipment throughput as corroborative volume)\n- Annual (US$ billions)\n  - FY2023: 18.258 (Others | Income statement | Sales of equipment for 2023Q1–Q4; Calculation)\n  - FY2024: 18.952 (8‑K | Income statement | Sales of equipment for 2024FY)\n  - FY2025E: 21.226 (Forecast; H1 actual run‑rate + seasonality; see quarterly below)\n  - FY2026E: 22.287 (Forecast)\n  - FY2027E: 23.401 (Forecast)\n  - FY2028E: 24.336 (Forecast)\n  - FY2029E: 25.309 (Forecast)\n- Quarterly (US$ billions)\n  - History (Q‑4 to Q‑1): 2024Q3 5.290 (Press release, Oct 23, 2024); 2024Q4 5.851 (Calculation from FY less Q1–Q3); 2025Q1 4.197; 2025Q2 4.894 (10‑Q/8‑K | Income statement | Sales of equipment)\n  - Forecast (Q0–Q3): 2025Q3 5.800; 2025Q4 6.335; 2026Q1 4.400; 2026Q2 5.000\n- Corroborative Wind equipment volume (units/GW; not a dollar driver but informs cadence)\n  - FY2023: 2,225 turbines; 8.5 GW (Others | KPI’s | Sales (in units) | Wind turbines; Wind turbines and repower (GW))\n  - FY2024: 1,778 turbines; 7.8 GW (Others | KPI’s | Sales (in units) | Wind turbines; Wind turbine gigawatts for 2024FY)\n  - FY2025E: 1,600 turbines; 7.5 GW (Forecast)\n  - FY2026E–FY2029E: 1,700; 1,800; 1,900; 2,000 turbines and 7.8; 8.2; 8.5; 9.0 GW (Forecast)\n\nDriver 2 — Services expansion (company “Sales of services” dollars)\n- Annual (US$ billions)\n  - FY2023: 14.981 (Others | Income statement | Sales of services for 2023Q1–Q4)\n  - FY2024: 15.983 (8‑K | Income statement | Sales of services for 2024FY)\n  - FY2025E: 17.101 (Forecast; Power services led; H1 +5% YoY)\n  - FY2026E: 18.256 (Forecast)\n  - FY2027E: 19.406 (Forecast)\n  - FY2028E: 20.563 (Forecast)\n  - FY2029E: 21.596 (Forecast)\n- Quarterly (US$ billions)\n  - History (Q‑4 to Q‑1): 2024Q3 3.620 (Press release, Oct 23, 2024); 2024Q4 4.711 (Calculation from FY less Q1–Q3); 2025Q1 3.835; 2025Q2 4.217 (10‑Q/8‑K | Income statement | Sales of services)\n  - Forecast (Q0–Q3): 2025Q3 4.100; 2025Q4 4.949; 2026Q1 3.950; 2026Q2 4.350\n\nDriver 3 — Orders and backlog/RPO conversion (Total orders; RPO at period end)\n- Annual (US$ billions)\n  - Total orders: FY2023 41.637; FY2024 44.107 (Others | KPI’s | Total orders).

Where filings show small summation gaps, differences reflect “Other/eliminations” and rounding.\n- Forecast method: Quarterly run‑rates and YoY patterns (H1 2025) anchor FY0; FY1–FY4 use segment-appropriate growth (Power services mid‑single‑digit; Electrification higher growth; Wind low‑single‑digit as Offshore backlog runs down). Equipment revenue growth exceeds unit growth on price/mix and Electrification project mix.\n- Orders/backlog: Quarterly order forecasts apply modest YoY growth with Q4 seasonality; RPO path assumes intake > revenue and continued Electrification capacity ramp. Backlog is a snapshot, not a revenue recognition schedule.\n- FX/M&A: FX is modeled as a small 2025 net headwind, neutral thereafter; M&A effects assumed de minimis absent disclosed deals.\n- Geography: Only annual geography is disclosed; quarterly geography is not reported; forecasts present mix assumptions tied to U.S. demand catalysts (data centers, onshore repowers) and steady international grid work.\n- Wind: Forecasts assume disciplined Onshore underwriting and no new Offshore backlog beyond legacy execution; unit volumes are low‑single‑digit growth with improving ASP/mix.\n- Consistency: Forecasts align with the latest reported quarters (through 2025Q2) and are intended to continue the company’s observed trajectory; actual results will vary with project timing, permitting, FX, and policy cadence."

    "one": "Synthesis note (optional)\n- Demand visibility is anchored by record RPO and services annuities in Power, while Electrification continues to outgrow the portfolio on a structurally expanding grid investment cycle. Mix remains the biggest quality lever: more Power services and more Electrification lift growth durability and margins. Wind is recovering off a volatile base; repower and services provide resilience, but equipment conversion remains cycle- and policy-sensitive. Pricing is positive across segments; capacity discipline (especially in gas equipment) supports price and backlog quality. The macro pattern that matters most near term is sustained datacenter and grid load growth in North America, with sovereign and utility grid programs globally.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts\nDriver 1.

Where quarterly datapoints are not disclosed (e.g., geography by quarter), we state “not disclosed.”\n- Forecast methodology:\n  - Segment revenues: 2025 Power mid-single-digit growth anchored to Q2 cadence and backlog; Electrification high-teens growth sustained by record backlog; Wind mid-single-digit decline in 2025 per company guidance, then gradual recovery driven by repower/services and selective equipment conversion.\n  - Services vs equipment: 2025 skew toward equipment (1H actual mix) with a gradual shift back toward services as the installed base expands and upgrades rise in 2026–2029.\n  - Orders/RPO: 2025 orders ≈$50B per company commentary; out-years assume mid-to-high single-digit growth with RPO increasing modestly net of revenue conversion.\n  - Organic growth (segment): Calibrated to disclosed 2024 and 1H25 prints; out-year run-rates reflect price discipline, mix, and backlog conversion, with Wind normalizing from a volatile base.\n  - Wind volumes: 2H seasonality assumed; repower increasing as a share of Wind; offshore contributions remain selective.\n  - Geography: Annual mix reflects U.S.-led demand in Power and Electrification (datacenter and grid) and a diversified Non-U.S. base; quarterly not disclosed.\n- Reliability: 2023 pre-spin comparability is acceptable for segment revenue via 10-Q disaggregation; minor differences to company totals reflect eliminations/other. Forecasts are management-aligned scenarios, not guidance.\n- Risk sensitivities: U.S. onshore policy/permitting and tariffs; HVDC/grid execution bandwidth; supply chain and inflation; hyperscaler build pace; peer capacity responses.

Where values are derived arithmetically from disclosed figures, they are marked as Analysis. Forecasts are based on disclosed backlog, run-rate trends, seasonality, and management commentary about demand and pricing.\n- Services growth: Power services grow mid-single-digit annually, supported by LTSA base (~1,700 units, ~10 years avg remaining) and upgrade intensity; Electrification services outgrow equipment on backlog scale; Wind services grow modestly on fleet maturity.\n- Backlog trajectory: Electrification backlog continues to expand as capacity debottlenecks and lead times remain elevated; Power RPO builds on strong equipment bookings; Wind RPO drifts lower near-term with limited offshore intake and stabilizes as backlog burns down.\n- Wind volumes/mix: Onshore new-unit volumes stabilize with U.S. mix and pricing selectivity; repower grows as a structural vector; offshore executed through 2026 with disciplined new awards. Quarterly turbine units for 2024 Q4 are computed from full-year minus YTD (Analysis).\n- Segment mix: Electrification grows fastest (mid/high-teens near term decelerating toward low teens), Power grows low/mid-single-digit led by services, Wind flattish in 2025 then low growth beyond 2026 as repower/services offset muted new-unit growth.\n- FX: Treated as a second-order driver annually; quarterly forecasts assume modest USD normalization. This does not constitute FX advice.\n- Data gaps: Some quarterly subcomponent disclosures (e.g., 2024 Q4 services split) are not provided in filings; we avoid imputing unless a simple reconciliation to disclosed totals is appropriate and marked as Analysis.\n- Risk factors: Offshore execution/quality remains the key downside variable; policy/tariff volatility can affect Wind; Electrification execution carries long-cycle risks; competitive intensity persists across all segments.\n- Currency: All figures in US Dollars."

earlier fiscal years are not available in this dataset. Where fewer than 5 historical years exist, I present all available.\n  - Quarterly “last 4” history uses 2024Q3–2025Q2, the latest reported quarters available; forecasts begin 2025Q3 (Q0).\n- Forecast method\n  - FY2025 equipment/services and segment forecasts anchor to 2025H1 actuals, typical H2 seasonality, and management context: 2025 orders ≈ $50B, backlog up ≥$13B, Electrification strength, stable-to-growing Power services, and selective Wind. FY2026+ apply segment‑specific CAGRs: Electrification mid‑teens early then easing; Power low-to-mid single-digit; Wind -12% in 2026 per onshore caution, then modest rebound. Equipment growth is tempered in 2026 by wind down; services grow high single digits initially, moderating over time.\n  - Volume forecasts (units/GW) reflect 2025H1 run rate, 2024 seasonal patterns, 60 Hz strength in Power, and flat-to-down near-term wind mix; gas GW grows with market additions; wind GW largely stable to slightly down in 2025 and down in 2026 on onshore.\n  - Orders/backlog: FY2025 total orders set to ~49,000 (≈$50B guidance), with equipment/services split similar to 2024; RPO YE 2025 assumes ≥$13B increase from YE2024 to ≈$132B. FY2026–FY2029 orders grow mid-single-digit; RPO climbs gradually.\n  - Geography: Mix shifts 1–2 pp toward U.S. through 2026 on 60 Hz momentum; limited historical granularity constrains precision.\n  - FX: Treated as a second‑order factor; set to ~neutral in forecasts given small magnitude vs. revenues historically.\n- Dependencies and risks\n  - Execution/timing: Offshore wind project timing and any incremental remediation could alter quarterly/annual segment skews and equipment/services mix.\n  - Policy and permitting: Onshore wind intake outside North America and interconnection timing could drive larger swings than modeled in wind units and revenue.\n  - Supply chain and pricing: Assumes continued price discipline and conversion of higher-margin backlog; material cost or logistics shocks would impact equipment.\n  - Backlog conversion: Assumes steady conversion of Electrification and Power backlogs; any deferrals would affect revenue phasing.\n- Currency: All figures in US Dollars; reported FX impacts taken from company KPI disclosures; forecast FX effects set to ~0 for planning simplicity.\n\nNotes\n- Historical inputs are sourced from GEV filings and KPIs through 2025Q2 (e.g., Sales of equipment/services, segment totals, unit volumes, orders, RPO).\n- Forecasts are explicitly assumptions-based projections designed to be a continuation of historical cadence and management context; they are not company guidance.",

Where multi‑year history is not disclosed in filings, I include “as available” per your rules and note the gap.\n\nSynthesis (brief)\n- Cross-driver themes: Backlog strength and price/terms discipline continue to tilt mix toward higher-quality, services-heavy revenue. Electrification stays the fastest-growing engine on structural grid demand and a seller’s market. Power’s installed base and gas-turbine cycle provide resilient annuity growth. Wind remains policy-/schedule-sensitive; repower and services help stabilize.\n- Catalysts: AI/data-center loads and interconnection bottlenecks support Electrification and Power. Offshore wind recovery depends on PPA resets and disciplined underwriting.\n- Near-term shape: 2025 services mid-single digit growth; Electrification high-teens to low-20s growth moderating thereafter; gas-turbine orders stay elevated in 2025; wind volumes remain selective with repower mix rising.\n\nDriver 1 — Services mix and attachment\nDefinition used: Company total services revenue; Power and Wind services are noted to anchor mix/attach trends.\n\nAnnual: history and forecast (USD millions)\n- FY2020: n/a (not disclosed in available segment/formats)\n- FY2021: n/a\n- FY2022: n/a\n- FY2023: 14,981\n- FY2024: 15,983\n- FY2025 (FYO): 16,942 (forecast; +6% YoY)\n- FY2026 (FY1): 17,789 (forecast; +5%)\n- FY2027 (FY2): 18,590 (forecast; +4.5%)\n- FY2028 (FY3): 19,334 (forecast; +4%)\n- FY2029 (FY4): 20,107 (forecast; +4%)\n\nQuarterly: last 4 actuals (Q-4 to Q-1), then Q0–Q3 forecast (USD millions)\n- Q-4: 2024 Q3 = 3,623\n- Q-3: 2024 Q4 = 4,707\n- Q-2: 2025 Q1 = 3,828\n- Q-1: 2025 Q2 = 4,205\n- Q0: 2025 Q4 = 4,900 (forecast)\n- Q1: 2026 Q1 = 3,950 (forecast)\n- Q2: 2026 Q2 = 4,350 (forecast)\n- Q3: 2026 Q3 = 4,050 (forecast)\n\nNotes\n- 2024 Power services = 12,391; Wind services = 1,642 (filed).

assumes no material execution shock in Wind services.\n- Electrification: High growth persists in 2025 (+~21%) on record backlog and elongated lead times; growth normalizes to mid-teens in 2026 and gradually to high-single digits by 2029 as capacity additions and affordability temper the seller’s market.\n- Orders and RPO: Book-to-bill remains ≥1x; 2025 orders up mid-single digits, with RPO building through year-end as conversion lags intake in Electrification and Power.\n- Gas turbines: 2025 remains a strong cycle year; subsequent years drift modestly lower from a high base as supply-demand normalizes.\n- Wind deliveries: 2025 slightly below 2024 on selectivity/offshore cadence; 2026 down low-teens vs 2025 per management tone; gradual recovery thereafter with repower share rising.\n- Macro: Assumes no severe recession, policy/regulatory status quo (IRA/European programs), and manageable tariff/inflation headwinds.\n\nCaveats and scope limits\n- Data availability: Pre-2023 annuals for several drivers (services by segment, Electrification revenue, gas/wind unit series, annual RPO) are not disclosed in the available dataset; I therefore present “as available,” per your rules.\n- Quarterly coverage: Q3 2025 line-items for some series were not available in the dataset at the time of analysis; “last four” quarter history therefore uses the most recent four reported (2024 Q3 to 2025 Q2).\n- Units vs dollars: Wind delivery and gas-turbine cycle drivers are unit/GW-based operating drivers, not USD; the impact on revenue depends on mix and pricing, which can diverge from volume.\n- Forecasts are estimates: They rely on backlog conversion patterns, reported YoY growth rates, seasonality, and management’s qualitative guidance; they are not company guidance.\n- Execution risks: Offshore wind legacy backlog, permitting/tariffs, and input inflation (management cited a ~$300–400M 2025 headwind net of mitigation) can alter cadence and revenue recognition timing.\n\nSources (from filings/data you provided)\n- Total services revenue: 2023–2024 actuals;

    "one": "Synthesis note (context to forecasts)\n- Mix and backlog underpin the trajectory. Electrification and Power are growing off healthy backlogs and pricing; Wind is guided down in 2025 and modeled lower again in 2026 as offshore backlog burns down and onshore new-unit pricing remains selective before stabilizing thereafter.\n- Macro tailwinds are grid-led capex expansion and firming-capacity demand for gas; wind financing cyclicality remains a swing factor. Management has emphasized services strength, backlog margin accretion and offshore underwriting discipline; we lean on those to shape the drivers.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts\nOnly the drivers in context are included.

Where only partial historical years are available (notably pre-2023), we present “as available.”\n- Forecast method: Segments are modeled top-down from 2024 actuals plus:\n  - 2025–2026: management color and observed H1 2025 trends (Electrification strength; Power services resilience; Wind guided down mid-single digits in 2025 and further down in 2026 for onshore).\n  - 2027–2029: grid-led growth, steady gas services/equipment growth, wind stabilization with modest growth post-2026.\n- Mix linkage: Equipment vs Services forecasts are allocated from segment-based totals and target a gradual rise in services share (consistent with backlog and installed-base monetization), while acknowledging that 1H25 equipment outgrew services.\n- Orders/backlog: 2025 total orders assumed ~$50B, consistent with management commentary; subsequent years assume mid-single to high-single digit growth. RPO growth is modeled to reflect sustained book-to-bill >1 in Electrification and healthy services attachment in Power.\n- Quarterly seasonality: Q4 remains the strongest; quarterly forecasts apply measured yoy growth by driver. 2025Q3 actuals were not included in the dataset; Q4 and 2026Q1–Q3 forecasts are built off corresponding prior-year quarters where available.\n- FX: Treated as a low, mean-reverting net over full-year horizons; quarterly swings can be material but are not forecastable with precision; we therefore use small placeholders.\n- Geography: Only 2024 regional split is disclosed; forward years apply proportional growth and a stable mix. Quarterly regional splits are not available.\n- Dependencies: Execution on large grid projects, gas equipment slotting and services outages, and the offshore wind backlog burn-down are key to conversion. Macro (rates, commodity prices), policy/tariffs, and supply-chain ramps can alter cadence.\n- Currency: All figures in US dollars. Totals may not tie exactly due to rounding and segment eliminations in filings.\n\nNotes on alignment with context\n- Electrification’s forecasted high-teens growth in 2025 aligns with backlog expansion and hyperscaler/ HVDC demand; Power’s mid-to-high-single digit growth reflects services stability and equipment price/mix; Wind’s 2025 decline and 2026 down-year reflect management’s guidance for onshore and cautious offshore burn-down.\n- The services share increases modestly through the horizon, consistent with RPO breadth and installed-base monetization.",
    "two": "Synthesis note\n- Cross-driver setup: Electrification is in a structural up‑cycle with orders outpacing revenue and backlog expanding; Power services continue to compound on the installed base; Wind equipment remains timing‑sensitive but is recovering YoY in 2025 YTD. FX remains a modest, variable factor.\n- Catalysts: Data‑center load and sovereign grid programs are lifting Electrification; Power services benefit from stronger outage scopes and pricing; Wind is improving as H1’24 delivery gaps normalized into H2’24 and 1H’25, with discipline on project underwriting.\n- Continuity: Forecasts extend the recent run‑rates seen in 2024–1H’25, respect segment seasonality, and scale with disclosed orders/RPO.

Companywide services revenue overlaps with Power services by construction; drivers are analyzed individually rather than summed.\n- Data coverage limits:\n  - Annual history is available from FY2023 as a standalone; earlier years are not disclosed in the provided context.\n  - 2024Q3 Electrification (~$1,825M) is derived from the 10‑Q’s +22% YoY disclosure and reconciled to the FY total; 2024Q4 Electrification (~$2,398M) is the residual. 2024Q3 company services ($3,620M) is from the press release; 2024Q4 services ($4,711M) is the FY residual.\n- Seasonality and phasing: Wind equipment shows pronounced H2 bias; forecasts preserve this pattern. Power services and company services show Q4 seasonal strength.\n- Growth calibration:\n  - Electrification: Strong 1H’25 growth (orders>revenue; higher RPO) supports a >20% FY25 step‑up, tapering to low‑double/high‑single digits through FY2029 in line with grid up‑cycle.\n  - Power services: Mid‑single‑digit organic trajectory consistent with services RPO, outage scopes, and pricing.\n  - Wind equipment: Modest growth off a normalized 2024H2 base, with continued delivery timing volatility.\n- FX: Forecasts are policy‑neutral; we assume no structural FX trend. Actuals can vary with dollar strength/weakness and geographic mix.\n- Dependencies on context: All historical numbers, YoY rates, and RPO/order signals come from GEV filings/press disclosures in the provided context. No external estimates were introduced.\n- Risk factors to trajectories: Wind project execution and permitting, offshore remediation costs, EPC bottlenecks, and macro/FX volatility could shift quarterly phasing and annual run‑rates; Electrification execution on large grid/HVDC projects is a key swing.\n\nThese forecasts align with the most recent run‑rates and disclosures, extend observed seasonality, and anchor medium‑term growth to the Electrification up‑cycle and services compounding, while keeping Wind equipment recovery measured and FX near neutral."

    "one": "Synthesis note (optional)\n- Cross-driver themes: A stronger services annuity (Power-led), a step-up in orders (≈$50B in 2025), and a deeper backlog underpin revenue conversion across the next 6–12 quarters.

upgrades and higher gas fleet utilization add tailwinds.\n- Electrification: Backlog expansion (YE2024 ~$23.5b → 2025Q2 ~$27.5b) plus policy-driven grid capex sustain mid-teens growth in 2025, decelerating to low double-digit as capacity expands and comps rise.\n- Wind: Onshore equipment stabilizes with better ASPs; offshore revenue cadence remains selective and execution-sensitive; overall equipment growth modeled mid-single-digit in 2025, easing thereafter.\n\nAssumptions and caveats\n- Scope and availability: GE Vernova’s standalone disclosures provide complete annual detail from FY2023; prior years are not presented as standalone in the same taxonomy. Where earlier years are unavailable, we present the most recent comparable history (FY2023–FY2024) and quarterly series from 2024Q3–2025Q2.\n- Quarterly datapoints:\n  - 2025Q1 services and some segment totals are based on company press release/1Q25 materials indicating YoY growth rates; where exact dollars were not itemized in filings excerpts, we computed approximate dollars by applying disclosed YoY % to the prior-year base. These are labeled as derived and used only to bridge to forecasts.\n  - 2025Q2 company totals (equipment/services) and Electrification/Wind segment splits are from 10-Q/KPI tables; Power 2Q25 totals are inferred from segment arithmetic (Total minus Electrification minus Wind), consistent with reported quarterly sums.\n- Forecast methodology:\n  - Annual forecasts are grounded in backlog trends (RPO), disclosed YoY growth in early 2025, and segment-level dynamics (Electrification outgrowing the group; services steady mid-single-digit; Wind improving but volatile). Quarterly forecasts use YoY growth applied to prior-year seasonal patterns.\n  - Orders and RPO forecasts are directional and assume mid-single-digit net new orders growth and slightly positive book-to-bill, consistent with a “higher-for-longer” gas cycle and strong grid demand, offset by selective Wind intake.\n- Risks and sensitivities: Offshore Wind execution and remediation costs, tariff/inflation headwinds (management cited ~$300–$400m 2025), permitting/financing timing (especially U.S. onshore), and potential pricing normalization in grids as industry capacity expands. FX can affect translation but is not modeled explicitly.\n- Consistency checks: FY2024 actuals reconcile to 10-K (Total revenues $34,935; Equipment $18,952; Services $15,983). Quarterly totals tie to disclosed 10-Q/8-K figures where available.\n\nThese forecasts maintain continuity with recent history: services compounding from a growing RPO base, Electrification leading growth on backlog conversion, and Wind equipment stabilizing with improved price/mix."

FY 2023 Power services value is a calculation from disclosed 2023 Power revenue and the YoY mix delta into 2024.\n- Seasonality and cadence\n  - Power services and Electrification revenues tend to be stronger in 2H; quarterly forecasts reflect this cadence and known outage seasonality.\n  - Wind equipment has pronounced quarter-to-quarter swings based on project timing; forecasts reflect 2026 onshore revenue down 10–15% vs 2025 as guided and a gradual recovery thereafter.\n- Orders/backlog metrics\n  - Adjusted total RPO (backlog) is used as the quarterly series for “Orders‑to‑revenue conversion” given consistent disclosure; FY 2025 total orders guided “~$50B” is applied for the annual forecast.\n- FX and pricing\n  - FX impacts are inherently volatile; quarterly/annual FX forecasts are scenario placeholders centered near zero after 2025 given lack of specific forward currency guidance.\n  - “Organic” growth data are included where disclosed; forward organic mixes are embedded implicitly in segment revenue/backlog forecasts rather than modeled separately.\n- Dependencies and risks\n  - Execution risk in Offshore Wind (install timelines, remediation), tariff headwinds in 2025 ($300–$400M at the company level, mitigated by pricing/clauses), and permitting/Interconnection delays could shift the quarterly Wind/Electrification profiles.\n  - Gas turbine capacity is tight through 2027–2029; pricing power and slot scarcity support Power equipment and, downstream, future services growth; any capacity or EPC bottlenecks would alter timing of orders conversion and services ramps.\n\nIf you would like, I can provide sensitivities around the Wind equipment path (±10% units/ASP) and Electrification conversion rates (backlog-to-revenue %) to quantify upside/downside ranges by quarter and year.",
    "two": "Optional synthesis note\n- Big picture: The 2025–2029 setup remains Electrification-led with durable Power services/equipment support and a more selective Wind trajectory. The backlog (RPO) continues to build on book-to-bill >1x, capacity scarcity in gas equipment, and grid investment urgency. The principal swing factor is Wind execution/mix; management commentary points to a softer 2025 for Wind and a down year in 2026 for Onshore before stabilizing.\n- Cross-driver themes:\n  - Orders and RPO are the leading indicators for topline: orders ≈ $50B in 2025 vs revenue ≈ $37B anchors multi-year conversion.\n  - Mix quality improves as Services grow and Electrification scales; FX remains a secondary swing factor.\n  - Policy and load growth (AI/data centers, industrial electrification) sustain Power’s services flywheel and Electrification’s expansion, while Wind remains policy- and execution-sensitive.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts\nUnless noted, figures are US$ millions.

(2) Equipment vs Services; (3) Orders growth and backlog conversion; (4) Wind unit volume and project timing; (5) FX impacts.\n- Data availability:\n  - Annual history is complete for 2023–2024; standalone history <5 years exists in filings; earlier years are not provided in the context.\n  - Quarterly history is complete for 2025Q1–Q2; select quarterly items for 2024Q3–Q4 are not disclosed in the provided context (notably Power/Electrification by quarter, and orders for some quarters). Where quarterly values are not disclosed, “n/a” is noted; annual context is used to anchor forecasts.\n- Forecast methodology:\n  - Segment revenues: 2025 reflects H1 actual momentum and management color (Power mid-single digits, Electrification high-teens/≈20%, Wind down mid-single digits). 2026 applies: Power +5%, Electrification +15%, Wind -12.5% (midpoint of management’s onshore down 10–15% commentary), then 2027–2029 Power ~4–5%, Electrification ~11–12%, Wind ~2% thereafter. Quarterly forecasts for 2025H2 are phased to typical H2 weighting; 2026Q1–Q2 are modeled as YoY growth vs 2025Q1–Q2 per annual assumptions.\n  - Equipment vs Services: 2025 equipment outgrows services (consistent with H1) at +10% vs +4%. Thereafter services outgrow equipment as the services flywheel builds (Power upgrades, attachment).\n  - Orders/RPO: 2025 orders ≈ $50B (management commentary), book-to-bill >1x; RPO evolves as prior RPO + Orders − Revenue; quarterly RPO forecasts are linearized to year-end objectives.\n  - FX: Neutral assumption from 2025H2 forward for base case; sensitivity to USD cycles remains.\n- Dependencies and risks:\n  - Policy and permitting (IRA pull-through for U.S. onshore; EU/UK grid/HVDC programs) materially influence Wind and Electrification.\n  - Gas turbine slot scarcity and services upgrade cycles support Power; however, macro shocks or supply chain tightness could affect delivery cadence.\n  - Offshore execution risk remains until backlog burn-down completes; tariffs/inflation are meaningful P&L swing factors.\n- Consistency: Forecasts are constructed to be a continuation of reported trends and backlog dynamics and align with stated 2025 orders ≈ $50B vs revenue ≈ $37B, Electrification strength, and Power services durability.\n- Reconciliation: Independent modeling of drivers (segment mix vs equipment/services) may not fully reconcile to the same consolidated totals each year/quarter; differences are small and reflect the different analytical cuts of revenue."

    "one": "Synthesis note (what ties the drivers together)\n- Services-led compounding and Electrification outgrowth: Services grew faster than equipment in 2024 (+8% organic vs +5% equipment) and continue to scale with Power LTSAs and outage intensity. Electrification is the structural share gainer (RPO up sharply; 2024 revenue +23.4% YoY), pulling mix toward grid hardware/systems/software.\n- Orders and RPO underpin revenue conversion: 2024 orders rose to $44.1B and RPO reached $119.0B at YE 2024, then $123.4B in 2025Q1 and $128.7B in 2025Q2, giving multi‑quarter visibility as long‑cycle projects convert.\n- Wind remains the swing factor: Onshore profitability has improved with selective intake, while Offshore execution still tempers growth; forecasts assume modest near‑term Wind revenue dip before stabilizing.\n- FX is noise vs fundamentals: 2024 full‑year FX impact on revenue was de minimis (−$6m), though quarterly swings can be meaningful.\n- Macro tailwinds intact: Data center/AI load growth, policy support (IRA/EU grids), and gas + grid reliability needs support mid‑ to high‑single‑digit growth in the addressable market, with pricing/mix favorable in Power and Electrification.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts and history (all USD millions)\n\nDriver 1 — Equipment revenue cycle (volume and price)\n- Annual history (as available)\n  - 2023: 18,258\n  - 2024: 18,952\n- Annual forecast\n  - 2025 (FY0): 19,710\n  - 2026 (FY1): 20,696\n  - 2027 (FY2): 21,838\n  - 2028 (FY3): 22,930\n  - 2029 (FY4): 23,961\n  - Rationale: Price/mix remains positive in Power and Electrification;

Naming is consistent across annual and quarterly views.\n- Data sources and derivations:\n  - Historical figures are from company filings/briefs in the provided context. 2024Q4 equipment was derived from FY 2024 equipment minus Q1–Q3. 2024Q4 total revenue was derived using the disclosed 2025Q1 step‑down of $2,527m; 2025Q1 total equals equipment + services. 2024Q4 services = total − equipment. 2024Q3 segment revenues and service mix are from the 10‑Q/press release; 2024Q4 Power revenue disclosed in the Jan 22, 2025 press release; 2024Q4 Wind inferred from the stated 2024Q4→2025Q1 decline. 2025Q2 RPO of $128.7B is from the 2025Q2 10‑Q.\n- Reconciliation: Segment annual totals from the dataset may not perfectly reconcile to company total revenue due to rounding, internal eliminations, or source differences; forecasts are built to be directionally consistent with the company’s mix and growth profile and align with equipment+services totals at the company level.\n- Forecast methodology: \n  - Equipment: mid‑single‑digit CAGR, reflecting Power and Electrification project conversion with cautious Wind near term.\n  - Services: high‑single‑digit growth, anchored by Power CSAs, outage scope, and Electrification services.\n  - Segments: Electrification outgrows; Power steady; Wind dips in 2025 on Offshore execution, then stabilizes.\n  - Orders/RPO: modest growth in orders; continued RPO build as intake exceeds revenue.\n  - FX: small full‑year impact; quarterly volatility possible.\n- Dependencies/risks: Offshore Wind execution/provisions, permitting/timing, tariff/inflation headwinds ($300–$400m cited for 2025), supply‑chain capacity (especially transformers/HVDC), and macro/FX can move outcomes vs. base case.\n- Currency: All figures in US dollars.\n- Period coverage limits: Earliest complete annual period available is FY 2023; quarterly coverage begins 2023Q1. Where fewer than 5 annual periods are available, all available periods are shown.",
    "two": "Synthesis note (brief)\n- Cross-driver themes: Momentum is anchored by services-heavy Power and capacity-constrained Electrification, with Wind stabilizing as legacy offshore backlog executes and onshore remains selective. Backlog (RPO) continues to build on book-to-bill >1.0, sustaining multi‑year visibility. \n- Macro/market read-through: Electrification benefits from a global grid build-out; Power rides firming-capacity needs and service upgrades; Wind volumes are recovering cautiously with U.S.-weighted onshore and disciplined offshore exposure. Forecast growth paces below TAM’s implied ~8.6% CAGR to reflect capacity/underwriting discipline and execution risk normalization.\n\nRevenue drivers and forecasts\nDriver 1: Segment mix (Power, Wind, Electrification) — revenue, USD millions\nAnnual\n- History\n  - FY2023: Power 17,436;

Asia ~23.5%; MEA ~21.0%; Non‑U.S. Am ~14.5%)\n  - FY2027–FY2029 (FY2–FY4): gradual shift of ~0.5 ppt per year toward Asia/MEA from Europe as grid and firming investments ramp in those regions; U.S. remains ~43–44% of total unless policy-driven step-ups occur\n\nQuarterly\n- History: Geographic revenue is disclosed annually; quarterly regional mix not available in the supplied dataset.\n- Forecast (Q0–Q3): Assume stable mix versus FY2025 annual outlook per quarter.\n\nKey assumptions underpinning the forecast\n- Power\n  - Services remain the growth ballast with mid‑single‑digit growth; new‑build equipment flattish to modest growth, price-positive. Segment revenue growth assumed: +7% in FY2025 then +5%, +4%, +4%, +3% through FY2029.\n- Wind\n  - Onshore U.S.-weighted intake and improving availability support stabilization; offshore backlog executes with bounded intake. Segment growth assumed: +2% FY2025, then +4–5% thereafter.\n  - Repower/services intensity rises; turbine unit forecast embeds lower base with gradual lift.\n- Electrification\n  - Capacity-constrained industry supports double‑digit growth near term; we assume +12% FY2025, +14% FY2026, moderating to high‑single-digit by FY2029 as capacity additions meet demand.\n- Orders/RPO\n  - Book-to-bill eases from ~1.26 (FY2024) to ~1.15 (FY2025) and gradually toward ~1.03 by FY2029; RPO builds annually given sustained >1.0 book‑to‑bill and multi‑year deliveries.\n- Equipment vs Services\n  - Services grow faster than equipment in 2025 on Power services and Wind/Onshore services; equipment accelerates with Electrification throughput as capacity ramps.\n- Seasonality\n  - H2-weighted revenue cadence maintained; Q4 strongest on project deliveries and outage seasonality.\n- Consolidation\n  - Segment sums exceed consolidated revenue due to eliminations; forecasts apply a consolidation factor consistent with FY2024 to bridge to consolidated totals.\n\nCaveats and scope limits\n- Data availability\n  - Annual history prior to FY2023 for segment revenues, equipment/services, and several KPIs is not in the supplied dataset; forecasts therefore anchor on FY2023–FY2024 history plus H1 FY2025 actuals.\n  - Quarterly “last 4” history for some drivers (segment revenues, equipment/services, unit GW, geographic mix) is partially unavailable; where missing, we clearly flagged the gap and did not backfill with invented historical numbers.\n- Forecasting methodology\n  - Forecasts are model-based estimates grounded in disclosed FY2023–FY2025 YTD trends, orders/RPO signals, and management’s mix/underwriting commentary. They are not management guidance.\n  - Book‑to‑bill and RPO quarterly bridges are simplified (RPO(t) ≈ RPO(t−1) + Orders − Revenue), excluding FX and other non-operating effects.\n- Consistency with filings\n  - All historical figures used are from the cited filings context. Segment totals versus consolidated totals differ due to eliminations; forecasts preserve that relationship.\n- Sensitivities\n  - Upside: Faster Electrification capacity adds; improved offshore re‑contracting; stronger Power upgrades.\n  - Downside: Offshore execution incidents; supply‑chain constraints in grid equipment; rate/policy-driven wind cadence; competitive pricing pressure, notably in Europe.\n\nNotes on sources (from provided context)\n- FY2024 consolidated revenue 34,935; equipment 18,952; services 15,983.

Only drivers in the provided context are modeled. All figures USD.\n- Method: FY2025 forecasts are built from H1 2025 actuals plus H2 YoY assumptions anchored in recent quarterly run-rates, orders momentum, and RPO. FY2026–FY2029 growth rates reflect the disclosed TAM expansion path (Electrification outgrowing, Power mid-single-digit with services, Wind low-to-mid single-digit as execution normalizes).\n- Eliminations: Segment totals include intersegment activity; consolidated totals are slightly lower due to eliminations/Other. Forecasts focus on drivers (segment/equipment/services/orders/backlog/units) rather than precise GAAP consolidated totals.\n- Organic growth percentages: Non-GAAP; modeled continuation beyond disclosed quarters, aligned with price/mix discipline and productivity. Actual results may vary with FX, mix, and policy/tariff impacts.\n- Wind volatility: Offshore execution, industry pricing, and U.S. interconnection timing remain material sensitivities. We assume steady normalization; setbacks could reduce Wind growth vs. our path.\n- Backlog/RPO: Company-level RPO was disclosed for 2024YE and 2025Q1; 2025Q2 total is inferred from segment disclosures (Power/Electrification/Wind) and presented as approximate. Future RPO depends on order timing vs revenue conversion.\n- Units vs revenue: Unit forecasts are indicative; revenue is more sensitive to mix, scope, and services attach than to pure unit counts, especially in Power and Electrification.\n\nIf you want these forecasts delivered in a spreadsheet by driver and time period, I can generate one.",
    "two": "Synthesis note\n- Backlog-led growth with improving price/mix: Services are the durable anchor while equipment is re-accelerating on gas turbines and grid equipment. Electrification is in a seller’s market (HV equipment/HVDC), Power is capacity-disciplined with premium slots, and Wind is the near-term swing factor (onshore stable/profitable; offshore execution normalizing). Orders and RPO growth outpace revenue, signaling multi-year conversion.\n- Key catalysts: 1) Data-center/AI load drives gas (baseload/peakers) and grid upgrades; 2) Electrification backlog expansion with rising lead-times; 3) Gas services upgrades intensity; 4) Policy normalization for onshore wind beginning 2026; 5) Pricing discipline embedded in new backlog.\n- Macro lens: Disinflation and supply-chain normalization aid conversion; FX is a second-order effect in the period observed. Tight EPC/manufacturing capacity supports pricing; U.S. demand is the current center of gravity.\n\nRevenue-driver forecasts\nDriver 1: Services expansion and installed-base utilization (USD, Sales of services)\n- What it captures: Consolidated services revenue across segments (Power, Electrification, Wind).\n\nAnnual\n- History\n  - 2020–2022: n/a (pre-spin/limited carve-out disclosure)\n  - 2023: 14,981 million (sum of quarters)\n  - 2024: 15,983 million\n- Forecast\n  - 2025 (FY0): 16,883 million\n  - 2026 (FY1): 17,727 million\n  - 2027 (FY2): 18,613 million\n  - 2028 (FY3): 19,544 million\n  - 2029 (FY4): 20,521 million\n\nQuarterly\n- History (last 4)\n  - 2024 Q3: 3,620 million (reported)\n  - 2024 Q4: 4,711 million (computed: FY less Q1–Q3)\n  - 2025 Q1: 3,835 million\n  - 2025 Q2: 4,217 million\n- Forecast (Q0–Q3; current Q0 = 2025 Q3)\n  - 2025 Q3: 3,801 million\n  - 2025 Q4: 4,994 million\n  - 2026 Q1: 4,027 million\n  - 2026 Q2: 4,428 million\n\nDriver 2: Equipment volume and mix (USD, Sales of equipment)\n- What it captures: Consolidated equipment revenue (Gas turbines, grid equipment, wind equipment).\n\nAnnual\n- History\n  - 2020–2022: n/a\n  - 2023: 18,258 million (sum of quarters)\n  - 2024: 18,952 million\n- Forecast\n  - 2025 (FY0): 21,570 million\n  - 2026 (FY1): 23,296 million\n  - 2027 (FY2): 24,694 million\n  - 2028 (FY3): 25,928 million\n  - 2029 (FY4): 26,965 million\n\nQuarterly\n- History (last 4)\n  - 2024 Q3: 5,290 million (reported)\n  - 2024 Q4: 5,851 million (computed: FY less Q1–Q3)\n  - 2025 Q1: 4,197 million\n  - 2025 Q2: 4,894 million\n- Forecast (Q0–Q3)\n  - 2025 Q3: 6,030 million\n  - 2025 Q4: 6,563 million\n  - 2026 Q1: 4,533 million\n  - 2026 Q2: 5,286 million\n\nDriver 3: Orders and RPO conversion\n- What it captures: Total orders (USD) and Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO/backlog, USD).

FY2026–FY2029 annual growth ~7% (aligned with company TAM high single-digit trajectory and Electrification capacity ramp).\n- Orders growth and RPO mechanics: Orders grow +8% in FY2025 then +7%, +6.5%, +6%, +5.5% thereafter; RPO evolves approximately as prior RPO + (Orders – Revenue), ignoring other adjustments; directional intent is to show backlog building with intake exceeding conversion.\n- Services mix: Services share steps up from 45.8% (2024) to 46.5% (2025), then +0.5 pp per year 2026–2029, consistent with Power’s service annuity and growing Electrification service attachment.\n- Segment mix: 2025 growth led by Electrification (+~18%) and Power (+~7%) with a modest Wind recovery (+~2%); thereafter, Power +~6% CAGR, Electrification +12%, +10%, +9%, +8% (decelerating as the base grows), Wind +~3% CAGR. Each year is scaled to the consolidated revenue total to ensure consistency.\n- Seasonality: Quarterly revenue allocation follows 2024 seasonality (Q1 ~21%, Q2 ~23.5%, Q3 ~25.5%, Q4 ~30.2%). H2 2025 split ~47%/53% across Q3/Q4.\n- Geographic allocations: 2025 regional growth weighted to Europe and MEA (HVDC, gas) and robust U.S. grid investment; regions are scaled to consolidated totals. Quarterly regional forecasts are proportional allocations of quarterly consolidated revenue to each region’s annual share.\n- FX: Modeled as a modest net FY2025 headwind (-50m) given H1 volatility; neutral thereafter.\n\nCaveats and scope limits\n- Data availability: Quarterly values are shown exactly where disclosed in the provided context (e.g., 2024Q3/2024Q4 for orders, services by quarter, and segment-by-quarter are not fully disclosed; marked n/a). Where quarterly breakouts are not provided, forecasts are shown, and history is limited to disclosed points.\n- Reconciliation: Segment sums may differ modestly from consolidated revenue due to eliminations/other; annual and quarterly segment forecasts are scaled or allocated to preserve consolidated totals where needed.\n- RPO: Year-end RPO forecasts approximate Orders minus Revenue flows and exclude potential currency, scope, and remeasurement effects; treat as directional.\n- Units cadence: Gas/wind unit forecasts reflect selectivity and market execution pacing; unit-to-revenue timing can vary (milestones, lead times).\n- FX: Quarterly FX effects are volatile; we provide a small balancing assumption for H2 2025 and flat thereafter.\n- This forecast is a continuation of the latest reported run-rate and backlog/orders profile, aligned with the company’s historical financials and the segment dynamics described in the provided context.",
    "two": "Synthesis note\n- Backlog-led growth with services core: Services expansion/attachment remains the most durable driver, underpinned by Power’s long-term service agreements and rising outage scope. Services grew mid-single digits in 2024 and continued to expand in 1H25, supported by rising RPO and upgrades.\n- Electrification as growth engine: The steepest growth continues to come from Electrification as grids invest to integrate renewables and data-center load. 1H25 Electrification revenue grew ~23% YoY, and the segment’s backlog continues to rise.\n- Wind improving but cadence-sensitive: Wind equipment revenue is recovering modestly with better pricing/discipline and offshore milestone cadence, while onshore repower and services drive stability. Variability remains highest here.\n- Orders>Revenue sustaining visibility: Total orders stayed >1x book-to-bill through 2024 and 1H25; RPO increased from $119.0B at 2024YE to $123.4B at 2025Q1 and approximately $129B at 2025Q2 (management disclosure). This supports multi-period revenue conversion, particularly in services and Electrification.\n- Macro backdrop: Policy support, electrification of end uses, and AI/data center load sustain demand; capacity discipline in gas/steam and price normalization in wind support mix and pricing.\n\nRevenue-driver forecasts and history\nAll figures USD.

outage scope/pricing remain positive; modest seasonality with Q4 highs.\n  - Electrification: strong 2025 on backlog and interconnection demand; growth decelerates from ~20% in 2025 toward high-single digits through 2029 as scale builds.\n  - Wind: modest revenue recovery as offshore milestones normalize and onshore selectivity continues; units/GW trend up gradually; execution cadence remains the key swing factor.\n  - Orders/RPO: 2025 orders ~ $49B and year-end RPO ~$133B reflect >1x book-to-bill, consistent with 1H pace and typical H2 seasonality.\n- Macro/policy\n  - Continued policy support (U.S. IRA/Europe HVDC programs) and AI/data center load growth sustain Electrification and Power demand; inflation cools, supporting real growth and execution.\n- Pricing and productivity\n  - Positive pricing across segments with incremental productivity offsetting cost inflation; services pricing stays firm in gas/steam; wind pricing normalized vs pre-2021.\n\nCaveats and scope limits\n- Data availability: As a recent spin, GAAP segment and driver time series are available from 2023 onward; prior five-year histories are not fully disclosed at the same granularity. Historical series above therefore use 2023–2024 actuals where available (10-K/10-Q/8-K/KPI).\n- Non-additivity of drivers: Drivers overlap (e.g., services vs. segment revenues). Sums across drivers will not equal consolidated revenue.\n- Orders/RPO timing: Quarter-to-quarter orders and RPO are inherently lumpy. 2025Q2 total RPO (~$129B) is from management commentary; filed RPO datapoints are included for 2024Q4 and 2025Q1.\n- Wind execution risk: Offshore schedule/provisions and onshore remediation can alter quarterly revenue/units. Forecasts assume improved but still variable cadence.\n- Organic YoY (%) is a company KPI sensitive to business dispositions/acquisitions and FX adjustments; forecasts assume stable methodology and moderate FX impact.\n- All figures in US dollars; forecasts are judgmental and conditioned on current backlog, demand signals, and management disclosures through 2025Q2."

    "one": "Synthesis note\n- Mix and backlog drive the trajectory. Power and Electrification are carrying growth with services density and multi-year project pipelines (RPO/backlog). Wind is improving off a low profitability base, with volumes normalizing and pricing/terms better than 2022–2023.

Where quarterly segment totals differ across presentation bases (GAAP external vs organic), GAAP external “Total | [Segment]” was prioritized when available.\n- Forecast method: Top‑down growth rates by driver calibrated to (a) disclosed 2024 actuals, (b) 2025H1 actuals, (c) backlog/orders cadence, and (d) market context from the addressable‑market analysis. Services mid‑single‑digit growth assumes stable utilization and pricing; equipment decelerates after 2025 as cycle normalizes. Segment growth reflects stronger Electrification, steady Power, and improving Wind.\n- Seasonality: H2 typically stronger for equipment; quarterly forecasts reflect that profile alongside YoY growth assumptions.\n- FX: Modeled as a de minimis full‑year factor (0 to low tens of millions) beyond 2025; actuals can vary by quarter with USD swings.\n- Orders/book‑to‑bill: Book‑to‑bill assumptions step down modestly from 1.20x (2025) to 1.05x (2029) as backlog depth normalizes while maintaining >1x coverage; orders forecasts are mechanically linked to revenue via these assumed ratios.\n- Dependencies: Execution timing on large grid/HVDC and gas projects, Wind conversion and pricing discipline, permitting, supply‑chain conditions, and customer prepayments can shift quarterly linearity; any of these can move equipment revenue and orders by several hundred million dollars quarter‑to‑quarter.\n- Currency: All figures are in U.S. dollars.",
    "two": "Optional synthesis note\n- Services-led compounding and backlog conversion are the dominant cross-driver themes. Power services and Electrification activity are outgrowing equipment, while Wind recovers in a more balanced onshore/repower mix with measured offshore phasing.\n- Catalysts: grid-capex step-up, rising firm-capacity needs (data centers), and policy support. These show up as higher Electrification revenues and growing Power RPO; Wind remains more timing/auction dependent.\n- Macro context: FX has been immaterial at the revenue level in FY 2024 (≈-$6M) but choppy intra-2025.

    "one": "Optional synthesis note\n- Cross-driver themes: Services are the anchor (large, long-duration RPO; positive pricing), Electrification is the structural growth engine (HVDC, transformers/switchgear; sharply rising backlog), Power is in a “higher-for-longer” upcycle with slot scarcity and price/mix tailwinds, and Wind remains mixed (improving services and onshore discipline; offshore execution still lumpy). Orders > revenue across segments continues to elevate RPO and supports multi-year visibility.\n- Macro/market context: Global grid capex has stepped up post-2023; gas equipment demand is tight on reliability and data-center load; wind is recovering selectively after an industry reset.

Where quarterly segment/services figures are not explicitly disclosed in the provided context (e.g., consolidated services in 2024 Q4 and 2025 Q1), these are marked “n/a.” Some quarterly Electrification values are computed from disclosed YoY rates (not separately itemized in dollars in context).\n- Seasonality: Quarterly forecasts are allocated using 2024’s consolidated seasonal profile (Q4 heaviest), then adjusted where actual YTD numbers exist (e.g., Wind H1 2025 actuals).\n- FX/organic: All figures are in USD. Filings often discuss “organic” growth; forecasts are on a reported USD basis, presuming broadly stable FX and no material M&A.\n- Pricing/mix: Power pricing and backlog margins are assumed to remain firm with slot scarcity; Electrification pricing remains positive but decelerating; Wind new-unit pricing stable-to-improving with services mix rising. Offshore execution remains a risk.\n- Orders/RPO: “RPO/backlog” terminology follows the filings. The ≈129,000 figure cited for 2025 Q2 reflects management commentary. Official RPO prints are taken from filings where explicitly stated (e.g., 119,023 at 2024 YE; 123,438 at 2025 Q1).\n- Risk sensitivities: Grid project timing/permitting; gas equipment delivery/slot conversion cadence; wind offshore execution and tariffs; tariff/inflation headwinds (estimated $300–$400M in 2025 net of mitigations) potentially shifting revenue recognition and margin conversion.\n\nIf you want these forecasts delivered in a spreadsheet with formulas and checks (e.g., tying quarterly builds to annual targets and backlogs by driver), I can generate and share it.",
    "two": "Synthesis note\n- Demand visibility remains strong. Orders outpaced revenue in 2023–2025 YTD, RPO grew sequentially into 1Q25, and Electrification backlog continues to expand. Power services and Electrification are the most dependable drivers; Wind is improving on delivery execution but remains policy- and execution-sensitive.\n- 2025 is product-led in the near term (equipment up mid-teens YTD) while services continue to grow mid-single digits and set up a stronger annuity base in 2026+. Electrification should remain the fastest-growing area; Power benefits from slot scarcity and pricing; Wind delivery momentum is offset by uneven orders intake and offshore execution risk.\n- Macro tailwinds: data center load, grid bottlenecks, and energy security are lifting orders and pricing (particularly in Power and Electrification).

Where a 2025Q2 segment total was not provided as an absolute, we derived it from disclosed YoY deltas versus 2024Q2 and reconciled to known totals. Segment sums can exceed consolidated revenue due to eliminations/intersegment effects.\n- Forecasting methodology\n  - Services: extrapolated from 1H25 growth (+5.2% YoY) with backlog/RPO support and stable 4Q seasonal uplift.\n  - Equipment: extrapolated from 1H25 growth (+16.4% YoY), with moderation from capacity constraints and underwriting discipline in out-years.\n  - Orders/RPO: anchored to 2025 commentary (orders ≈ $50B) and observed 1H25 orders; RPO path reflects orders>revenue and Electrification backlog expansion.\n  - Segment mix: 2025 split apportions total revenue growth consistent with 1H25 contribution by segment; 2026 Wind down 10% reflects management’s directional commentary on softer onshore in 2026, then gradual stabilization; Electrification remains the fastest grower mid‑teens; Power grows low-to-mid single digits with services strength and equipment pricing.\n  - FX: quarterly swings modeled small and net-neutral over multi-year horizons; 2025 includes known 1H effects.\n  - Geographic mix: quarterly not disclosed; annual forecasts shift modestly toward U.S. given data center and grid momentum.\n- Dependencies and risks\n  - Wind execution/tariffs remain the key swing factor; offshore project timing and remediation can move revenue between quarters and affect services profitability.\n  - Electrification HVDC awards in Europe have seen deferrals; backlog quality remains strong, but timing may shift quarter to quarter.\n  - Gas equipment slot scarcity supports pricing and revenue, but industry capacity additions could change price/mix trajectory beyond 2026–2027.\n  - FX volatility can distort quarterly reported growth though 2024 full-year impact was negligible (−$6M).\n- Reconciliation notes\n  - Segment totals vs consolidated revenue differ due to intersegment eliminations. Annual eliminations were ~−$442M in 2024; quarterly eliminations are not disclosed consistently and therefore not explicitly modeled.\n\nIf you would like, I can deliver these series in a spreadsheet with separate tabs per driver (annual and quarterly), including “A” vs “F” flags and footnotes for each derived datapoint."

Wind is stabilizing with selective underwriting; volume and quarterly order timing remain lumpy.\n- Macro catalysts: data center load growth, grid bottlenecks (HVDC/transformers), and firming needs for intermittent renewables continue to favor Electrification and Power. Wind outlook improves gradually as offshore resets and U.S. onshore IRA benefits persist; China remains a large but less addressable unit market for GEV.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts\nAll dollars are USD.

Non‑U.S. mix proportional to FY24 actual composition unless local policy shifts drive divergence.\n\nCross‑driver linkages and realism checks\n- The FY2025 revenue forecasts implied by the services/equipment view (38.1B) and the segment view (39.1B) are within ~2.5% of each other. Both are consistent with 1H25 +10.9% YoY and >1x book‑to‑bill.\n- RPO roll‑forward ties orders and revenue into consistent YE RPO growth (+$8.1B FY25E to ~127.1B), aligning with disclosed 2025 YTD increases (total RPO 123.4B at 2025Q1; Power RPO 79.1B at 2025Q2).\n- Quarterly book‑to‑bill remains ≥1.0x through the forecast horizon, consistent with sustained backlog build.\n\nAssumptions and caveats\n- Scope limits: We use only GE Vernova disclosures (10‑K/10‑Q/8‑K/KPI) for historicals. Quarterly geography breakouts are not disclosed; we allocate quarterly regional mix using FY2024 composition and modest U.S. share drift.\n- Forecasting method: Point estimates are based on 1H25 actuals, known orders/RPO momentum, seasonal patterns, and multi‑year TAM logic. They are not company guidance.\n- Wind volumes: Ex‑China selectivity and offshore repricing keep near‑term unit forecasts conservative; quarterly orders remain lumpy.\n- FX: Modeled conservatively near zero over a year; quarterly values are directional and may deviate with currency volatility.\n- RPO math: Simple roll‑forward (RPO_end ≈ RPO_begin + Orders − Revenue) ignores FX revaluation, cancellations, and scope changes.\n- All figures are USD; rounding may create small summation differences.\n\nKey sources (select)\n- Income statement and segment revenues: 2024FY 8‑K; 2025Q1–Q2 10‑Q; 2023Q1–Q4 10‑Q (Total revenues; Sales of services; Sales of equipment; Segment totals for Power, Wind, Electrification).\n- Orders and backlog: KPI disclosures (Total orders by quarter/year; Remaining performance obligations; Power RPO).\n- Geography: 2024FY 10‑K geographic revenue (U.S., non‑U.S., and regional components).\n- Equipment volumes: KPI “Orders | Gas turbines (units, gwd)” and “Orders | Wind turbines (units, GW)” by quarter/year.",

Proxies are indicative only since equipment revenue spans beyond turbine hardware.\n  - Orders/backlog: Book-to-bill near 1.0–1.05 supports modest RPO growth in 2025 (~128B YE), then stabilization as revenue conversion tracks orders. Quarterly order forecasts tie to revenue cadence.\n  - Geographic mix: 2025 U.S. share gently higher (~43%), then normalizes toward ~41.5% by 2029; quarterly geo mix not disclosed—quarterly forecasts assume annual share.\n- Dependencies and risks\n  - Program timing: HVDC and Offshore cadence can shift quarterly equipment/services mix and segment revenue. Quarterly forecasts assume no material slippage beyond typical phasing.\n  - Policy/tariffs: Tariff headwinds and auction/permitting timing may alter Wind/Electrification trajectory intra-year.\n  - Accessibility/SAM: Wind growth outside China is the relevant pool for GEV; global wind spikes do not fully translate to accessible volumes.\n  - RPO arithmetic: Quarterly total RPO for 2025Q2 is estimated by summing segment RPO tags (Power ~79.1B; Wind ~22.5B; Electrification ~27.5B); official consolidated RPO balance was not separately tagged that quarter.\n- Rounding: Totals may differ from sums due to rounding and intersegment eliminations. Where segment totals are used, they tie to segment disclosures; GAAP consolidated totals reflect eliminations.\n\nThis forecast set ties each driver’s trajectory to observed 2023–2025 patterns (equipment-led acceleration in 2025, Electrification outgrowth, steady Power services, improving Wind) while maintaining continuity with reported filings and backlog dynamics."

    "one": "Synthesis note\n- Cross-driver themes: Backlog depth and pricing power anchor forecasts. Power’s services-led annuity and sold-forward heavy-duty gas turbine (HDGT) slots into 2026–2029 support steady growth and mid-teens seasonal margins. Electrification is in a seller’s market with accelerating RPO and hyperscaler-led demand, sustaining double‑digit growth albeit with gradually decelerating price benefits as productivity takes over. Wind remains the swing factor: onshore is selectively profitable with repower strength while offshore execution remains the key risk; 2026 onshore revenue is guided lower without policy clarity.\n- Catalysts: U.S. load growth (data centers), policy-enabled grid awards (HVDC/transformers), premium-slot pricing in HDGT, onshore fleet reliability investments, and selective offshore backlog burn-down.

This is consistent with sold-forward gas slots, rising upgrade content, and Electrification’s RPO expansion (HVDC/transformers).\n- Equipment vs services: Services remain the larger growth contributor to profits; revenue mix tilts modestly back to equipment near term on gas equipment deliveries, then rebalances as service intensity rises (upgrade content and higher utilization).\n- Orders/RPO: Orders track HDGT scarcity and grid buildout; RPO rises to ~132B in 2025E as Electrification accelerates and Power services deepen. Conversion follows multi-quarter cycles with stronger Q4 seasonality.\n- Wind units/mix: Repower and services mitigate unit softness in 2025–2026; offshore losses run off as projects complete under legacy terms; selective participation continues until economics reset.\n- Pricing/FX: Price remains positive in Power and Electrification; Electrification price growth gradually decelerates as productivity drives margins. FX remains a secondary, mixed tailwind/headwind.\n\nAssumptions and caveats\n- Scope/data availability\n  - GE Vernova became a standalone filer in 2024; only 2023–2024 provide complete, comparable segment detail. Pre‑2023 five-year history by driver is not available in standalone format.\n  - Quarterly historical detail is shown where disclosed; several 2024Q4 and 2025Q1 line-items (by segment and equipment/services) were not disclosed in the source excerpts and are labeled n/a rather than estimated.\n- Forecast method\n  - FY2025–FY2029 forecasts align with disclosed guidance and structural signals: Power mid-single-digit growth; Electrification mid/high-teens tapering to low-double-digit; Wind down mid-single digits in 2025 with a further decline in 2026 (per management commentary), then stabilizing.\n  - Quarterly forecasts apply 2023 segment-specific seasonality to 2025–2026 segment totals to ensure continuity; actual quarterly phasing will vary with outage timing, project execution, and backlog conversion.\n- Dependencies and sensitivities\n  - Orders/RPO conversion assumes stable EPC/supply chain capacity and permitting; offshore execution remains a risk. Tariffs (~$300–$400m 2025 headwind net of mitigations) and European affordability could affect price/mix, especially in Electrification.\n  - Data center/load growth underpins Power (equipment and services) and Electrification; delays in interconnections or policy changes (IRA, EU packages, local content) would change timing.\n  - FX effects were modest in 2024; forecasts assume continued small net impact.\n- Currency: All figures in U.S. dollars. Rounding may cause small summation differences.\n\nKey sources (high level)\n- 10-K (Feb 6, 2025): Segment revenues/margins; services mix; RPO by segment; geography.\n- 8-K/KPIs: Total revenue; equipment/services; organic growth; orders; RPO.\n- 10-Qs (Apr 23, 2025; Oct 23, 2024): Quarterly segment detail (Power/Wind), equipment/services (company in 3Q24), RPO by segment, services RPO.\n- Earnings/press releases (Oct 23, 2024; Jan 22, 2025; May/Jul 2025 calls): Q3/Q4 performance; 2025 guidance; orders/backlog; pricing dynamics; HDGT slots; Electrification demand.\n- Wind KPIs: units, repowers, GW.",
    "two": "Synthesis note\n- Backlog-driven growth and services density are the core cross-driver themes. Electrification’s backlog is compounding fastest, Power’s services annuity is rising with higher outage scope and premium slot pricing, while Wind remains the swing factor with policy/permitting timing. Near term, I anchor FY2025 on management’s “~$37B revenue” commentary with orders ≈$50B and ≥$13B backlog build, then layer moderate growth from backlog conversion and services attachment; 2026 assumes a Wind step-down consistent with management’s caution, followed by recovery as permitting and interconnection improve (10-K/8-K/10-Q/transcripts cited below where historical figures are used).\n\nRevenue drivers to forecast (only those in context)\n1) Segment mix (Power vs. Wind vs. Electrification)\n2) Services growth and attachment vs. equipment\n3) Equipment price/mix (Power gas turbines and Wind turbines)\n4) Orders and backlog conversion\n5) FX translation\n6) Geographic mix\n\nDriver 1.

wind is mixed (onshore softness in 2026 vs 2025 with offshore normalization).\n\nDriver 1: Segment mix (segment revenues)\n- Annual (history then forecast; $m)\n  - Power:\n    - FY2023: 17,293\n    - FY2024: 18,127\n    - FY2025E: 19,758\n    - FY2026E: 21,142\n    - FY2027E: 22,199\n    - FY2028E: 23,087\n    - FY2029E: 23,779\n  - Wind:\n    - FY2023: 9,815\n    - FY2024: 9,701\n    - FY2025E: 10,186\n    - FY2026E: 9,677\n    - FY2027E: 9,870\n    - FY2028E: 10,166\n    - FY2029E: 10,471\n  - Electrification:\n    - FY2023: 6,118\n    - FY2024: 7,550\n    - FY2025E: 9,211\n    - FY2026E: 10,593\n    - FY2027E: 11,864\n    - FY2028E: 13,050\n    - FY2029E: 14,094\n\n- Quarterly (last 4 actuals, then next 4 forecasts;

no quarterly historical or forecast provided for this driver.\n\nShort assumptions and caveats\n- Scope and sources: Historicals come from GEV filings/IR data points referenced in the context (10-K/10-Q/8-K KPIs and segment/geography schedules). Only drivers specified in the context are modeled.\n- Limited FY history: Standalone post-spin history provides FY2023–FY2024 and 2025H1; fewer than 5 historical fiscal years are available, so I show “as available.”\n- Segment forecasts:\n  - Power: FY2025E +9% (H1 +9% YoY and 2025 Power TAM strength), then +7%/+5%/+4%/+3% (2026–2029) as the gas cycle normalizes with services compounding.\n  - Electrification: FY2025E +22% (H1 +22.6% YoY; 2025 TAM step-up), then +15%/+12%/+10%/+8% (2026–2029) as capacity expands but pricing moderates.\n  - Wind: FY2025E +5% (H1 +11%), FY2026E -5% (management indicated onshore down 10–15% vs 2025; offshore stabilization offsets part), then +2%/+3%/+3% (2027–2029).\n- Seasonality: Quarterly segment forecasts allocate H2 by 2024 H2 shares for Q3/Q4 and use 2024 quarterly weights for 2026Q1–Q2; this ties the forecast to disclosed seasonality.\n- Equipment vs services: Forecasts are derived from segment totals using 2024 service shares (Power ≈68.36%, Wind ≈16.93%, Electrification ≈25.47%). Mix may drift upward in services, but I held shares constant to avoid over-fitting without new disclosures.\n- Orders and RPO: FY2025 orders +10% YoY to 48.5B; book-to-bill remains >1x through FY2029E; RPO path (FY2025E–FY2029E) is an estimate aligned with orders>revenue over the horizon and multi-year conversion. Quarterly order forecasts use 2024 seasonal proportions. RPO quarterly beyond disclosed periods is not modeled.\n- Organic revenue change: The company’s disclosures show values like 0.20 that correspond to ~20%; the forecast keeps that convention (0.20 = 20%).\n- FX: 2024 FY net was -$6m; 2025E set as a modest headwind given Q1/Q2 swings, then assumed neutral from 2026E onward for planning simplicity.\n- Geographic mix: Quarterly geo data not disclosed; annual forecasts apply a modestly rising US share to forecast total revenue (segment sum minus a -$450m elimination proxy).\n- Uncertainty: Wind execution and policy cadence, electrification capacity additions and pricing discipline, gas project timing, and FX volatility can shift quarterly realization vs trend. Where data was not available, I stated assumptions explicitly and avoided introducing new drivers.",
    "two": "Synthesis note (one paragraph)\nAcross GE Vernova’s disclosed revenue drivers, the through-line is durable backlog-led conversion, a rising services mix, and an outsized Electrification upswing that offsets volatility in Wind. 2025 demand is strong (orders ≈ $50B vs ≈ $37B revenue; backlog up ≥ $13B), supported by grid modernization and firm-power needs tied to AI/data centers. Policy/tariff frictions and offshore execution keep Wind choppy; management has signaled onshore 2026 revenue down 10–15% vs 2025. Our forecasts continue these patterns: mid-/high-single-digit growth in Power anchored by services, double-digit Electrification growth sustained by expanding RPO, and a flat 2025 Wind baseline followed by a 2026 digestion and gradual recovery.

Key datapoints include 2024FY total and segment revenues; 2023FY constructed from quarterly filings; 2025Q1–Q2 totals and segment splits; quarterly equipment/services totals; orders (2024Q3, 2024Q4, 2025Q1, 2025Q2); and RPO (2024Q4 total; 2025Q1 total; 2025Q2 by segment).\n- FY2025 revenue anchor: Calibrated to management framing of ≈$37B 2025 revenue with ≈$50B orders. H2 2025 quarterly totals allocated using 2024 H2 seasonality; segment allocations use 2025H1 average mix and 2024 seasonal segment split.\n- Segment sums vs company total: Minor variances arise from “Other/eliminations” in segment reporting; totals may not reconcile to the dollar due to those eliminations and rounding.\n- Equipment/services forecasts: H2 2025 equipment share uses 2024 H2 seasonality; 2026+ assumes equipment growth from Electrification and gas equipment conversion, with steady services uplift from Power.\n- Volume forecasts: 2025 gas GW reflects visible H1 step-up and backlog conversion; 2026 onshore wind revenue headwinds are reflected as lower wind units; repower/services partly offset at the revenue line.\n- Orders and RPO: 2025–2029 orders are grown mid‑single to high‑single digits in line with TAM and disclosed demand cadence; RPO increases modeled as Orders > Revenue with modest working-capital timing.\n- Geographic forecasts: Company provides only annual geography; quarterly geography is not disclosed. Annual geography forecasts reflect U.S. share creep (grid/hyperscalers), MEA strength (gas/services), and steady Europe.\n- FX: Modeled as a small FY headwind in 2025 based on 1H prints, reverting to neutral thereafter; actuals can vary with USD path and mix.\n- Risks: Permitting/tariffs and offshore execution (Wind), supply-chain and HVDC execution risk (Electrification), project timing on large equipment shipments, and FX swings. Upside from U.S. grid acceleration, gas “slot scarcity” pricing, and hyperscaler demand conversion.\n\nIf you want, I can deliver these forecasts in a spreadsheet with reconciliation tabs (segment, equipment/services, orders/RPO, and volumes) for sensitivity analysis.",

Where quarterly segment/services details are not disclosed, I leave them as n/a rather than estimate.\n- FY2025 revenue anchor: Management indicated ~$37B 2025 revenue and ~$50B orders; FY2025 segment forecasts are scaled to that consolidated anchor, with H2 seasonality consistent with 2024.\n- Out-years (FY2026–FY2029): \n  - Power: mid-single-digit revenue growth anchored in services; gas turbine units normalizing slightly from 2025’s elevated backdrop.\n  - Electrification: double-digit growth decelerating as capacity expands and grid capex normalizes from a “seller’s market.”\n  - Wind: 2026 onshore down 10–15% per management tone; thereafter low-to-mid single-digit recovery, aided by repower/services.\n- Services mix: Assumes services outgrowth vs equipment (services +7/8/7/6/5% in 2025–2029) with share rising toward ~48–49% on quarterly cadence and ~50% longer term.\n- Orders/RPO: 2025 year-end RPO set to at least ~$132.5B (≥+$13B vs 2024YE) with steady gains thereafter. Quarterly RPO splits beyond 2025Q1 are not disclosed; I show annual targets.\n- FX: 2025 full-year FX modeled as small net headwind (−$0.05B) given 1H prints; 2026+ neutral for planning simplicity.\n- Units (Wind and Gas): Annual-only where disclosed; quarterly units not reported in filings. I avoid fabricating quarterly unit splits; revenue cadence already reflects typical H2/Q4 weighting.\n- Dependencies and risks: \n  - Onshore Wind order cadence (permitting/tariffs, rates); Offshore execution without adding uneconomic backlog.\n  - Electrification execution at scale (lead times, underwriting discipline).\n  - Power services utilization and upgrade intensity; new-build slot discipline.\n  - Macro/policy sensitivities (IRA, European HVDC programs, China/EU competitive dynamics).\n- Currency: All figures presented in U.S. dollars. “$B” rounded to two decimals; unit counts rounded to nearest unit.

No new drivers introduced.\n- Data availability: Annual history before 2023 and many quarterly breakouts (e.g., 2024 Q3–Q4 by segment; 2024 Q3–Q4 equipment/services; 2024 Q3–Q4 orders; quarterly wind/gas units for 2024 Q3–Q4) are not disclosed in the provided context; these are shown as “N/A” rather than estimated.\n- Seasonality and cadence: Quarterly forecasts are seasonalized off recent cadence (H2 typically stronger for equipment), RPO/order momentum, and the segment narratives (Electrification acceleration, steady Power services, Wind normalization with offshore).\n- TAM glide path anchor: Out-year growth rates are informed by management’s TAM expansion toward ≥$435B by 2030 (~8.6% implied CAGR), with higher growth in Electrification, steady mid-single-digit in Power, and improving but still selective growth in Wind.\n- FX: Treated as a minor driver; 2025 forecast assumes a small net headwind based on 2025H1 prints, then flat thereafter. This is a simplifying assumption; actual FX could vary.\n- Units vs revenue: Unit forecasts (wind turbines and gas turbines) reflect volume trajectory; they are not converted to USD as they are operational KPIs. Revenue forecasts incorporate price/mix via segment trends and services penetration.\n- Risk factors: Offshore wind execution/timing, permitting and policy variability, supply-chain inflation, and competitive dynamics (esp. onshore wind ex-U.S.) can shift quarterly phasing and full-year outcomes. Backlog quality and potential schedule shifts are the main swing factors for revenue conversion.\n- Consistency: All figures reflect values cited in context; where multiple 2023 segment sets exist in the narrative, this forecast uses the internally consistent set that sums to the company total (Power 17,293; Wind 9,815; Electrification 6,118)."

    "one": "Synthesis (brief)\n- Multi-year setup: Power services are the most reliable growth engine; Electrification is in a multi-year upcycle on grid constraints and AI/data-center demand; Wind is stabilizing as offshore backlog is executed and repriced projects begin to flow from 2026. This mix shift supports steadier growth and margin quality.\n- Near-term cadence: 2025 continues to lean on Power services and Electrification conversion; Wind normalizes vs. 2024’s offshore provisioning cycle. Policy-enabled TAM tailwinds remain strong; execution and capacity are the gating variables.\n- Forecast approach: Bottom-up, anchored to disclosed 2023–2025 actuals (through 2025 Q2) with conservative growth/mix assumptions tied to segment TAMs and reported RPO/orders. FX assumed neutral.\n\nNote on history span\n- GEV has standalone public history from 2023 onward.

Pre-2023 standalone data are not available for GEV; therefore, “last 5 fiscal years” includes all available years (2023–2024) and forward forecasts (2025–2029).\n- Forecast method: \n  - Power revenue: +6% in FY2025, then ~+4.5% CAGR (services-led; large installed base and RPO).\n  - Electrification revenue: +20% in FY2025, then +12% (2026) and +10% thereafter (grid upcycle, seller’s market gradually normalizing).\n  - Wind revenue: −2% in FY2025 (normalization vs 2024 provisioning), then recovery with +3% (2026) and +5% thereafter as repriced offshore projects convert and U.S. onshore remains healthy.\n  - Sales split: Equipment ~54%/Services ~46% in 2025–2026, trending modestly toward more services by 2029; quarterly seasonality uses 45%/55% H1/H2 split where not disclosed.\n  - Orders: +6% per year from the 2024 base; RPO rises gradually as orders exceed revenue in Electrification and services renewals remain strong.\n  - FX: Neutral beyond the disclosed 2025 Q1–Q2 effects given lack of forward rate guidance.\n- Consistency checks: Equipment + Services equals Total revenue by design; segment totals sum to total revenue before “Other/eliminations.” Small differences between segment sums and total revenues by quarter reflect historical eliminations/other items not forecasted separately.\n- Units: Equipment units (gas turbines and wind turbines) are provided to illuminate volume/mix; forecasts are directional and consistent with revenue growth but are not company guidance.\n- Risk and sensitivity: Biggest sensitivities are offshore wind execution timing and any new component-quality events; Electrification supply bottlenecks and permitting; gas turbine services utilization; and price competition from Chinese OEMs in wind. Material FX/rate moves would also change reported figures.\n- Use case: These are planning-quality projections to frame revenue drivers. They are not management guidance and should be stress-tested against future filings and order/RPO updates.",
    "two": "Synthesis note (context and cross-driver themes)\n- The 2025 setup is backlog-led. Services remain the ballast, Electrification is the structural growth engine (grid), and Power (gas services + selective equipment) supports steady expansion, while Wind normalizes under tighter underwriting. Orders > revenue and rising RPO provide multi-year conversion visibility. Near term, equipment outgrows services on grid slot ramp and project cadence; over the medium term, growth converges toward a mid-single/high-single digit TAM pace, with Electrification > Power > Wind by growth rate.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts\nAll figures in USD.

Forecast quarters are 2025Q3, 2025Q4, 2026Q1, 2026Q2.\n- RPO quarterly totals: When “total remaining performance obligations” was not explicitly provided, we sum segment RPOs (Electrification + Power + Wind) to estimate the total (e.g., 2024Q3 ≈ $118.2B; 2025Q2 ≈ $129.1B).\n- Forecast method:\n  - Equipment: H1’25 YoY trends (+16–17%) applied with moderation in H2; outer years taper toward ~6–8% to reflect supply normalization and TAM growth.\n  - Services: Mid-single-digit growth anchored by Power services and rising Electrification services.\n  - Segments: FY’25 growth rates derived from YTD run-rates (Power ~+8.5%, Wind ~+10%, Electrification ~+24%) with outer-year deceleration (Electrification remains the fastest).\n  - Orders and RPO: FY’25 orders ≈ +5% YoY (H1 +4.7% YoY), then +6%, +6%, +5%, +5% thereafter; RPO YE progression assumes sustained book-to-bill >1.0 and disciplined backlog conversion.\n  - Price/organic: Annual reported growth used as the proxy at the FY level; quarterly organic YoY from company KPIs drives near-term cadence.\n- Seasonality and execution: Q4 typically strongest. Offshore wind execution and transformer/HVDC lead-times can shift quarterly revenue recognition; forecasts reflect that seasonality and known cadence.\n- FX/M&A: Forecasts assume organic equals reported (no material FX or M&A effects), consistent with recent disclosures.\n- Reconciliation: Segment totals may not sum to reported totals due to intersegment eliminations. Equipment + services equals total revenue by definition; minor rounding differences may occur.\n- Risk factors: Policy, permitting, and project execution (especially offshore wind), component/QA risks in grid equipment, and commodity/interest-rate dynamics can alter order intake, conversion timing, and nominal growth via price effects."

All figures in US dollars.\n\nSynthesis note (optional)\n- Cross-driver themes: The 2024–2026 trajectory is defined by: (i) durable Power services growth supported by LTSAs and upgrades; (ii) a structurally tight gas-turbine order environment with premium-slot pricing and high U.S. demand (data centers, reliability); (iii) steep Electrification backlog growth converting to revenue; and (iv) Wind normalization—U.S.-centric onshore profitability, with offshore backlog executed down into 2026.\n- Catalysts: U.S. load growth (AI/data centers), HVDC/transmission awards and commissioning cadence, gas new-unit booking/scarcity, and onshore wind interconnection/permits. Offshore execution milestones (Vineyard, Dogger) remain the swing factor for Wind.\n- Macro context: Grid buildout and firming capacity needs continue to support orders and RPO; FX effects are episodic; pricing remains positive across Power and Electrification with backlog margin accretion.\n\nRevenue drivers and forecasts\nOnly drivers from context are included.

Pre‑2023 annuals and several quarter-level splits (e.g., 2024Q4 equipment/services; certain quarterly orders) are not disclosed in the provided context and are marked n/a.\n  - All historical numbers are from company filings/transcripts cited in the context; forecasts are analyst estimates consistent with disclosed trends, orders/RPO, and management commentary.\n- Methodology (high level)\n  - Equipment vs Services: 2025 total revenue set near ~38.0B based on H1 actuals and run‑rate; equipment/services split extrapolates 2025H1 mix, with services growing slightly faster than equipment thereafter (installed‑base compounding).\n  - Power services: Mid‑single‑digit annual growth trajectory anchored to services RPO (~$60B+) and outage/upgrade cadence; quarterly seasonality assumes stronger Q4.\n  - Gas turbine orders (GW): 2025 at ~23 GW given strong H1 and scarcity/premium slots; normalization toward capacity-constrained steady state through 2029.\n  - Wind deliveries (GW): 2025 down mid‑single digits vs 2024; 2026 down ~10–15% as guided; modest recovery thereafter as onshore interconnection improves and offshore backlog runs down by 2026.\n  - Orders and RPO: Orders growth modestly above 2024 on Electrification/Power momentum; RPO builds through 2026 then grows at a slower pace as offshore runoff is offset by Electrification/Power.\n  - FX: Forecasts assume FX-neutral; quarterly history uses disclosed impacts where available.\n- Dependencies and risks\n  - Electrification conversion relies on commissioning timing, HVDC/transmission execution, and supply-chain throughput; delays could shift revenue across quarters.\n  - Power equipment deliveries depend on EPC schedules and production ramp to 70–80 HDGTs/year (by 2026–2027); services growth tied to outage windows and utilization.\n  - Wind forecasts depend on U.S. onshore interconnection/permits, interest rates, and offshore execution (Vineyard/Dogger). Offshore backlog execution through 2026 remains a key risk variable for both timing and margin.\n  - Policy/tariffs and customer capital budgets could change order timing; FX can be a quarterly optical driver even if full-year is muted.\n- Alignment with past data\n  - Forecasts expressly continue the observed 2023–2025 run‑rates: Electrification-led equipment growth; steady Power services; gas orders elevated; wind volume moderated with services expanding; total company orders and RPO rising and converting steadily.\n\nIf you want, I can package these as spreadsheets and include per-driver charts for history vs forecast.",
    "two": "Synthesis note\n- Mix and timing matter. Electrification is the fastest structural grower; Power is in a multi‑year equipment upcycle with a very large, durable services base; Wind is volatile with U.S. onshore resilience/repower and offshore execution still normalizing. Orders and RPO continue to run well ahead of in‑period revenue, so conversion timing drives quarterly patterns.\n- Pricing remains constructive across segments, particularly in Power equipment (slot scarcity) and grid hardware; services price/mix is positive in Power and stabilizing in Wind. FX is a second‑order quarterly noise factor vs mix/backlog.\n- Near‑term risk skew: Wind (orders softness in early 2025, offshore remediation) vs. tailwinds in Gas and Grids (AI/data‑center load, grid modernization). Management comments point to mid‑single‑digit Power growth in 2025 and Electrification growth outpacing the company, while Wind is guided down mid‑single digits.\n\nAll figures in USD unless units/GW noted. “n/a” indicates not disclosed in filings;

Where quarterly datapoints were not disclosed (e.g., some 2024 Q4 unit KPIs, segment splits), they are labeled “n/a.” Forecasts are estimates derived from disclosed order trends, backlog/RPO, guidance, and industry context (IEA/GWEC) and are not company guidance.\n- Timing lags: Orders and RPO convert to revenue over multi‑quarter/multi‑year cycles; quarterly forecasts reflect seasonality and execution timing, especially in Power (outage seasons) and Electrification (project milestones).\n- FX: Forecast assumes modest translation volatility near term and neutral FX thereafter; actual effects may differ materially with USD strength/weakness.\n- Wind sensitivity: Onshore orders are sensitive to U.S. permitting/interconnection; offshore execution/remediation can alter quarterly revenue recognition and services intensity. Management has indicated onshore 2026 revenue −10–15% vs 2025; forecasts incorporate this.\n- Power cycle: Gas turbine demand remains strong (slot scarcity; premium pricing) but shipments are capacity‑gated. Forecast units/GW reflect management’s capacity plans (70–80 HDGT/yr by 2H26) plus aeroderivatives.\n- Electrification: Backlog growth and lead‑time elongation imply multi‑year revenue conversion; forecasts assume continued positive price/terms and capacity additions proceed as planned.\n- No M&A or divestiture effects modeled; all figures US Dollars. Organic rates are company‑disclosed where available; otherwise directionally extrapolated from the latest run‑rate.\n\nIf you want these drivers delivered as downloadable tables (annual and quarterly) with formulas and embedded citations, I can generate a spreadsheet."

    "one": "Synthesis note (context for all drivers)\n- GEV’s revenue engine is anchored by backlog conversion and services annuities in Power, with Electrification scaling into a structurally undersupplied grid market; Wind is managed selectively with onshore discipline and legacy offshore backlog burning through ~2026. Orders > revenue since 2023 raised RPO, securing multi‑quarter visibility.\n- Macro/TAM backdrop remains supportive: rising data‑center/AI load, grid modernization, and policy supports. Management commentary points to 2025 orders near ~$50B vs. ~$37B revenue and a growing RPO base, while onshore wind volumes soften into 2026 (mid-teens revenue decline guide), offset by Power/Electrification strength.\n\nAll figures in USD millions unless stated; fiscal year is calendar-year. Historical actuals are from GEV filings; forecasts reflect stated mix/underwriting posture, RPO/orders, and disclosed end‑market cadence, with assumptions noted at the end.\n\nDriver 1 — Equipment vs. Services Mix\n- What this driver captures: revenue split between Sales of equipment and Sales of services.\n\nAnnual\n- FY2020: NA (standalone series not disclosed)\n- FY2021: NA\n- FY2022: NA\n- FY2023: Equipment 18,258;

organic YoY stays positive low‑teens basis‑points paced by Power/Electrification.\n\nAssumptions and caveats\n- Scope and data availability: GEV’s standalone history is limited; complete company-level series begin 2023/2024. Where FY2020–FY2022 values are NA, the company did not provide the comparable standalone lines. Quarterly and annual actuals cited are from filed 8-K/10-Q/10-K datasets.\n- FY2025 anchors:\n  - Total revenue ≈ $37B (orders ~$50B; RPO rising). Segment FY2025 forecasts are sized to this envelope and H1 actuals.\n  - Equipment/services mix for forecasts uses 2024 within-segment composition to maintain continuity.\n- Segment outlook:\n  - Power: demand supported by higher structural load and gas slot scarcity; +7% in 2026 vs. 2025 assumed.\n  - Electrification: fastest growth; +15% in 2026 driven by grid capacity constraints and RPO.\n  - Wind: onshore 2026 revenue down 10–15% vs. 2025; we use -12% at segment level for 2026, with a modest recovery thereafter.

    "one": "Optional synthesis note\n- Broad theme: Grid-led growth with a firming generation cycle. Electrification continues to comp compound at mid-to-high-teens on robust HV equipment/HVDC and pricing, while Power’s services annuity grows steadily on outages, upgrades and LTSA coverage. Wind is stabilizing—Onshore profitability and services attach are improving, but Offshore continues to temper growth; the medium-term swing factor is U.S. repowers and execution on legacy offshore backlog.\n- Catalysts: 1) Electrification awards/backlog conversion and capacity unlocks; 2) HDGT slot discipline and upgrades in Power; 3) Wind execution (legacy offshore burn-down, U.S. repower cadence); 4) Orders/RPO trajectory supporting conversion visibility.\n- Macro context: TAM expansion in grids and dispatchable generation (data centers, coal-to-gas, reliability) keeps demand elevated; pricing remains constructive across segments.

Shipments (GW) track lower in 2025 before gradual recovery into 2026–2029.\n- Power services:\n  - Mid-single-digit annual growth profile anchored by LTSA base (~1,700 units; ~10 years avg remaining), outage/upgrade activity, and pricing/productivity gains. Services share in Power sustained near ~69%.\n- Electrification:\n  - Mid-to-high-teens revenue growth in FY2025, moderating gradually as the base grows; supported by HV equipment/HVDC awards, longer lead-times, and capacity expansions. Pricing remains constructive.\n- Orders and RPO:\n  - Orders grow in line with the TAM glide path and capacity constraints, with Q4 seasonality strongest. RPO builds steadily as bookings outpace revenue conversion at the portfolio level.\n- Equipment vs services mix:\n  - Mix shifts gradually toward services over time given Power/Wind installed-base monetization, though Electrification’s equipment-led surge keeps equipment share elevated near term.\n\nWhat’s included and how history supports the trajectory\n- Annual actuals: 2023–2024 total and by segment; 2024 orders and RPO; equipment/services totals.\n- Quarterly actuals: 2024Q3–2025Q2 by segment (Power, Wind, Electrification) plus total orders and company equipment/services where disclosed; Q4 2024 total company revenue derived from full-year less Q1–Q3.\n- Forecasts roll forward from H1’25 run-rate, management’s 2025 directional commentary, and segment-specific visibility (orders/RPO).\n\nAssumptions and caveats\n- Scope and data limits:\n  - GEV’s standalone disclosure history is limited (comprehensive: 2023–YTD 2025). Where quarterly splits were not fully disclosed (e.g., companywide equipment/services in 2024Q4), we flagged the gap rather than interpolating.\n  - Segment totals are sourced from 10-Q/10-K/press releases; some quarterly figures (e.g., 2024Q4) are derived arithmetically from filed totals where segment and consolidated data allow exact residual computation.\n- Forecasting method:\n  - FY2025–FY2029 projections are not company guidance; they apply observed H1’25 growth, management’s qualitative outlook (mid-single-digit Power, mid-to-high-teens Electrification, Wind down mid-single digits in 2025), and seasonality to produce internally consistent quarterly and annual paths.\n  - Orders and RPO forecasts reflect a continuation of 2024–2025 momentum and TAM growth; quarterly orders keep Q4 seasonality strongest.\n- Dependencies and risks:\n  - Execution on legacy offshore wind projects; permitting and interconnection for grid deployments; tariffs/FX; EPC capacity/timing; and macro financing conditions could shift volume/timing.\n  - Electrification cadence depends on supply chain capacity unlocks and HVDC project schedules; Power’s upgrades/outage timing can introduce intra-year volatility.\n- Currency: All figures in nominal U.S. dollars; no FX normalization beyond reported GAAP.\n\nIf you want, I can deliver these as a spreadsheet with linked sources and editable growth assumptions for each driver to tweak scenarios.",
    "two": "Synthesis (themes, catalysts, macro)\n- Electrification is the structural growth engine. Orders/backlog and a seller’s market in grid equipment are pulling revenue forward; disciplined underwriting and better T&Cs support sustained growth and improved conversion.\n- Power Services remains the ballast. A large LTSA base (~1,700 gas units; ~10 years average remaining) and positive pricing/productivity drive recurring growth with visibility (Power services revenue +5.4% in 2024; Q1–Q2 2025 up YoY).\n- Wind Equipment is managed for value. Onshore is selective, repowers are solid, and no new offshore backlog unless economics improve. 2025 rebounds modestly off a 2024 dip; 2026 reflects expected onshore order softness before a gradual recovery.\n- Orders and RPO underpin multi‑year visibility. 2024 orders +5.9% to $44.1B; 2025 orders targeted ~$50B with RPO up ≥$13B. Backlog margin improved (~+5 pts YoY), increasing revenue quality.\n- Mix shift and FX.

segment/driver granularity before 2023 is limited. Where FY2020–FY2022 datapoints are not disclosed in the stand‑alone series, they are marked n/a.\n  - Quarterly segment disaggregation is not fully disclosed for all quarters; where unavailable, we provided the latest available quarters and clearly labeled gaps.\n- Power Services\n  - FY2025 growth (+5%) anchored on: Q1–Q2 2025 YoY increases in Power services; Power RPO growth from $73.4B (YE24) to ~$79.1B (Q2’25); continued positive pricing/productivity. FY2026–FY2029 modeled at ~4% CAGR as a stable annuity with upgrades expansion.\n- Wind Equipment and units\n  - FY2025 revenue +5% on improved execution and selective onshore; FY2026 −10% consistent with management’s commentary that onshore 2026 revenue could be down 10–15%. Gradual recovery thereafter assumes repower momentum and offshore risk containment (no new offshore backlog unless economics improve).\n  - Units follow revenue trajectory with mix/pricing continuing to offset some unit cyclicality.\n- Electrification\n  - FY2025 +20% reflects strong H1 cadence and order/backlog momentum; FY2026–FY2029 taper to 10/9/8/7% as capacity and execution scale.\n- Orders and RPO\n  - FY2025 orders ~$50B and RPO +≥$13B are based on management indications; subsequent years assume orders modestly outpace revenue to build RPO through 2029. RPO is shown at year‑end; quarterly RPO forecasts are EoQ estimates for visibility only.\n- Mix (Equipment vs Services)\n  - FY2025 total revenue implicitly ~$37.0B (equipment ~$19.9B; services ~$17.1B), consistent with management commentary for ~2025 revenue cadence. Services continue to grow faster than equipment thereafter, tilting mix toward resilience.\n- FX\n  - FX was immaterial in 2024 (−$6M), so we assume neutral in the forecast absent new volatility; actuals can deviate with currency moves.\n- Dependencies and risks\n  - Execution: offshore project completion (remaining backlog ~multi‑year), onshore fleet remediation, grid project delivery.\n  - Market: permitting/tariffs for onshore wind, EPC capacity/schedule for gas CCGTs, interconnection/rate dynamics affecting grid rollouts.\n  - Pricing: forecast presumes “positive price” and improved T&Cs sustain; competitive intensity or policy shifts could alter price realization.\n  - All forecasts are model‑based translations of disclosed trends (orders/RPO growth, quarterly run‑rates, guidance commentary) and will require update as new quarters are reported.\n\nKey source anchors (selected)\n- Power services revenue FY2023 11,758; FY2024 12,391; 2025 Q1 2,924; Q2 3,254.

    "one": "Synthesis note (context and cross-driver themes)\n- Backlog-led cycle. Orders exceeded revenue in 2023–2024 (book-to-bill ≈1.25–1.26x) and RPO stepped from ~$117.7B (2024Q3) to ~$128.7B (2025Q2). That supports equipment delivery growth into late 2025–2027, especially in Electrification and Power.\n- Mix shift to Electrification and annuity-like Services. Electrification RPO rose sharply and remains equipment-heavy; Power’s services depth underpins resilience. Wind is recovering with selective onshore and normalized offshore underwriting.\n- Macro overlay. Grid/electrification is capacity-constrained; gas demand benefits from data-center load and reliability; FX translation should remain a modest, noisy tailwind/headwind quarter to quarter.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts\nAll values in US dollars.

These are explicitly marked as “derived.”\n- Forecast basis:\n  - Equipment: H2’25 growth aligned with RPO conversion cadence and observed 1H momentum; tapering growth path post-2026 as capacity ramps normalize.\n  - Services: Mid-single-digit growth sustained by Power LTSAs (~10-year average remaining life) and improving Wind service attach as reliability improves.\n  - Segment mix: Electrification remains the fastest grower (double-digit), Power steady (services-led with moderate equipment uplift), Wind recovering with disciplined offshore and selective onshore.\n  - Orders/RPO: Book-to-bill maintained modestly >1.0x; RPO grows but at a slowing rate as delivery capacity expands.\n  - FX: Assumes range-bound USD; low full-year net impact after natural hedges and geographic mix.\n- Dependencies and risks: Offshore wind execution/timing, permitting/tariffs (notably in U.S. onshore and cross-border supply chains), supply-chain capacity (HVDC/transformers), commodity/FX moves, and project phasing could shift quarterly profiles. Electrification execution pace and Power slot reservation conversions are the largest swing factors for H2’25–2027.\n- Currency: All figures presented in US dollars; RPO figures shown in billions to reflect disclosure convention; revenues in millions.\n- Consolidation note: Segment external revenues sum to more than consolidated revenue due to eliminations/other (-$442M in 2024). Our FY2025 consolidated revenue inference (~$38.9B) applies a similar eliminations assumption to the segment forecasts; actual eliminations may vary with mix.\n\nSources (all from filings/disclosures cited in context)\n- Revenues, segment revenues, equipment/services splits, orders, RPO (total and by segment), and FX effects per quarter: 10-K (Feb 6, 2025), 10-Qs (Apr 23, 2025; Jul 23, 2025; Oct 23, 2024), and 8-K/press materials referenced in the provided context.",

Currency: US dollars.\n\nSynthesis note (optional)\n- Mix and visibility: Services and Electrification growth, paired with a durable Power Services base, continue to stabilize revenue. Wind normalizes after a 2023 peak and 2024 reset, with repower and selective projects supporting steadier volumes.\n- Orders/backlog underpin the trajectory: 2024 orders grew 5.9% YoY and RPO expanded into 2025, supporting multi-quarter conversion. Electrification backlog rose sharply; Power Services annuity continues to expand modestly; Wind backlog is lower but still sizable.\n- Near-term cadence: 2025 H1 showed broad-based growth (equipment cycle strength plus services).

Where FY-5 not available, I show all available years (2023–2024) and the most recent quarters (through 2025Q2).\n- Segment mix shares are computed on the sum of segment revenues (Power + Electrification + Wind), excluding “Other/eliminations,” to avoid intersegment-elimination noise. Year shares: FY2023 and FY2024 reflect filed segment totals.\n- Wind volume cycle (GW): Quarterly 2023–2025Q2 are actuals; FY2023 total (~8.5 GW) is the sum of quarterly filings; the 2025–2029 series assumes normalization with low-single-digit growth as execution and repower cycles progress.\n- Orders/RPO: Quarterly orders are actuals through 2025Q2; RPO totals are actual at 2024Q4 and 2025Q1. Forward RPO levels are estimated paths tied to book-to-bill around or modestly above 1.0 and Electrification backlog expansion.\n- Services penetration: 2025–2026 service mix modestly lower vs 2024 given the equipment upcycle, then gradually rises with Electrification services and Power Services growth.\n- FX translation: Annual impacts are typically small; I model FY2025 as a net headwind based on H1 actuals and then fade impacts toward zero thereafter. Quarterly FX forecasts are stylized and should be treated as low-confidence placeholders; actuals depend on currency moves.\n- Alignment check: FY2025 total revenue trajectory implied by the mix/driver forecasts is consistent with H1 2025 growth and seasonal H2 uplift; segment and services forecasts are anchored to 2024–2025 actual cadence and backlog visibility.\n- Risks: Electrification milestone timing; wind project phasing; supply-chain execution; FX volatility. Opportunities: further Electrification awards conversion; stronger-than-expected Power Services upgrades; wind repower momentum.\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver these driver series as a CSV or spreadsheet with embedded formulas for easy updates as 2025Q3/Q4 results are filed."

    "one": "Synthesis note (context and trajectory)\n- Electrification demand and Power services are the durable growth anchors. Orders breadth and multi‑year RPO gains indicate higher backlog conversion through 2026+, while capacity constraints support pricing. Wind is managed for profitability with selective onshore volumes and a constrained offshore posture. \n- Macro catalysts: AI/data‑center load, reliability investments, and policy‑supported grid/HVDC awards lift Electrification and Power. Offshore wind repricing and US onshore policy timing shape Wind’s near‑term slope. \n- Implication for forecasting: raise Electrification and Power steadily (services-led), keep Wind volumes around 2025’s ~2,000 shipments with disciplined ASP/mix, and reflect continued backlog expansion as 2025 orders (~$50B) outpace revenue (~$37B).\n\nDriver 1 — Orders and backlog conversion\n- Definition: Total orders (USD) and remaining performance obligations/backlog snapshots (USD), used to infer forward revenue conversion.\n\nAnnual (USD, millions;

Out‑years assume orders modestly above revenue, sustaining backlog growth.\n  - Equipment vs services: 2024 seasonality and mix used to frame 2025H2; services share rises gradually as Power services and Electrification scale.\n  - Segment mix: Electrification grows faster (HVDC, transformers, grid stabilization); Power grows steadily (services-led); Wind managed for profitability with ~2,000 shipments in 2025 and a modest volume step‑down in 2026 (onshore revenue −10% to −15% noted by management), stabilizing thereafter.\n  - Wind ASP proxy: Equipment revenue per unit is an approximation; offshore content, repower mix, and FX can distort implied ASP. Volumes reflect onshore/offshore combined shipments as disclosed.\n- Dependencies and risks\n  - Policy/tariffs and permitting pacing (notably for US onshore wind) can alter volumes and timing; offshore execution risk remains a swing factor.\n  - Supply-chain constraints (e.g., long‑lead forgings/castings, HVDC/BOP bottlenecks) can shift quarterly conversion.\n  - AI/data center demand trajectory influences Electrification and Power; a slowdown could flatten orders growth.\n- Currency and rounding\n  - All figures are in US dollars. Minor differences between segment, category, and consolidated totals may reflect eliminations/rounding. Where necessary, quarterly distributions were adjusted to maintain full‑year alignment.",
    "two": "Synthesis (what ties the drivers together)\n- Backlog-led growth: Book-to-bill above 1 in 2024 and through 2025 YTD, with RPO rising from $119,023m (2024Q4) to $123,438m (2025Q1) and segment components still expanding in 2025Q2, supports a multi-quarter conversion runway.\n- Mix quality improves: Services outgrew equipment in 2024; Power services remains the earnings anchor while Electrification’s backlog expansion drives outsized growth, steadily lifting the company’s services mix and revenue quality.\n- Wind normalization: Wind revenue is stable-to-slightly down near term, with services resilience and selective onshore/offshore participation; the company signals 2026 onshore down 10–15% vs 2025, consistent with our 2026 Wind outlook.\n- Macro catalysts: Tight power supply, hyperscaler/data center demand, and grid interconnection bottlenecks lift Electrification and firming capacity needs (Power).

Services ~$470m); ~330 units\n  - Q3 2026Q2: $2,050m (Equipment ~$1,580m; Services ~$470m); ~340 units\n\nKey assumptions and caveats\n- Scope and sources: All historical figures are from GE Vernova filings/quarterlies provided in context. Pre-2023 segment histories are not available in the provided dataset (GEV’s standalone reporting period); thus, “last five fiscal years” is fulfilled on an “as available” basis.\n- Seasonality and phasing: Quarterly forecasts assume similar 2H-weighted seasonality as 2024, with Q4 typically strongest for equipment and services conversion.\n- Electrification growth: Driven by RPO expansion (2025Q1 $25.5b to 2025Q2 $27.5b). We assume continued supply-constrained pricing and lead times that support high-teens growth in 2025, decelerating to low-teens by 2029 as base enlarges.\n- Power services: Assumes continued high LTSA attachment and outage scope; services grow mid-single-digit annually, consistent with rising installed-base utilization/upgrades and RPO progression (~$79.1b Power RPO by 2025Q2).\n- Wind trajectory: Aligns with management’s indication that 2026 onshore revenue will be down 10–15% vs 2025; services contribution gradually rises as a stabilizer. Offshore execution risk and repricing dynamics are embedded as a modest drag in 2025–2026 before gradual normalization.\n- Orders/RPO: 2025 orders modeled at ~$50b (per management commentary), with year-end RPO ~ $132b; subsequent years maintain book-to-bill modestly above 1. Quarterly RPO forecasts are rounded and indicative (not disclosed in filings at that granularity in context).\n- Mix and eliminations: Company-level totals reflect eliminations historically (~$0.44b in 2024). Forecasts apply a similar proportional offset between segment sums and consolidated revenue.\n- Currency and inflation: All values are nominal USD. No FX translation adjustments are modeled beyond those implicitly captured in recent actuals.\n- Risk factors: Policy/permitting (Wind), offshore project execution, supply chain/lead time impacts on grid equipment, and any shift in gas utilization (Power) could change timing and magnitudes of conversion.\n\nIf you want these forecasts in a spreadsheet with formulas and an assumptions page, say “Build the model,” and I’ll generate a file you can download."

    "one": "Synthesis note (base case)\n- Electrification remains the fastest growth engine as grid and data-center demand pull through long-cycle equipment and services. Power stays resilient on a growing services base and a multi‑year gas equipment upcycle. Wind stabilizes near term with softer onshore units and improving services/repower, followed by recovery post‑2026 as policy/financing normalize and offshore repricing supports selective bids.\n- Orders > revenue and expanding RPO underpin visibility. I anchor the FY2025 base to the company’s orders outlook (~$50B) and the 1H25 revenue cadence, then taper or accelerate each driver in line with backlog conversion, segment guidance signals, and disclosed secular trends (TAM ~7–8% CAGR to 2030).\n- All figures in USD.

total orders 44,107m; YE24 RPO 119,023m; FY2024 Power/Wind/Electrification revenues 18,127m/9,701m/7,550m). 1H25 totals (revenue 17,143m; equipment 9,091m; services 8,052m; segment revenues) are also from the cited 10-Qs. 2024Q3 equipment/services (5,289m/3,624m) and 2024Q3 segment revenues are reconciled to FY figures given disclosed Q1, Q2, Q4 amounts.\n\nAssumptions and caveats\n- Scope and sources: Historical figures come from the reported data embedded in your context (8-K/10-K/10-Q/KPIs). Where quarterly gaps existed (e.g., 2024Q3 equipment/services), I reconciled using FY minus known quarters. For metrics not disclosed quarterly (e.g., total orders 2024Q3–Q4), I show the most recent quarters available and explicitly mark limited availability.\n- Forecast framework:\n  - FY2025 base: anchored to 1H25 growth (+10.9% YoY total revenue) and company commentary (orders ~50B; backlog up ≥$13B) with FY2025 total revenue normalized to ≈$37.8B. Quarterly FY2025 Q3–Q4 apply YoY growth to 2024 comps and are calibrated to the FY base.\n  - Segment: Power low‑single‑digit growth (services-heavy) through cycle; Electrification high growth in 2025–2027, tapering as capacity/productivity normalizes; Wind slight 2025 growth, then -10–15% in 2026 (midpoint used), recovering thereafter on repower/services and selective offshore.\n  - Equipment vs services: 2025 reflects product-heavy 1H cadence with services steady; over 2026–2029 services mix rises with installed base and upgrades.\n  - Orders/RPO: 2025 orders ~50B; book‑to‑bill >1 sustains RPO growth. Out‑years modestly increase orders and RPO in line with secular backlog build.\n  - FX: Treated as de minimis over full-year horizons after 2025; quarterly oscillations modeled but small vs organic trends.\n  - Units: Gas turbine orders remain elevated in 2025 (mid‑cycle upturn; HA/aero), easing slightly thereafter; wind orders units/GW remain subdued in 2025–2026 with gradual recovery from 2027.\n- Dependencies/risks: \n  - Policy, permitting, tariffs, and financing conditions can shift wind/electrification timing; 2026 onshore softness embedded per management commentary.\n  - HVDC/mega‑project execution (electrification) and offshore risk management affect conversion cadence and margin, but not total TAM. \n  - FX unpredictable quarterly; assumed immaterial annually post‑2025.\n  - Forecasts are single‑point base cases; actuals will vary with mix, execution, and macro. \n- Currency: All figures are USD; rounding may cause minor summation differences.\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver these series in a spreadsheet and add sensitivity cases (e.g., wind -15% vs -10% in 2026; electrification +/‑ 300 bps growth bands) and show the impact on orders, book‑to‑bill, and RPO trajectories.",

Backlog and orders (RPO up to $128.7B by 2025 Q2) provide multi-year visibility.\n- Catalysts: Electrification super-cycle (HVDC/grid), data-center/AI load supporting Gas Power and Services, and disciplined underwriting that improves revenue-per-unit. Offshore wind exposure winds down into 2026 under tightened intake economics.\n- Macro backdrop: Grid capex strength and firming needs in power support Power/Electrification; Wind remains bifurcated (China vs ex-China).

Longer-term growth leans on Electrification HVDC/grid ramp and steady Gas Power demand; Wind normalizes post-2026 as offshore backlog winds down without uneconomic intake.\n  - Services revenue: Continues to expand mid-single to ~6% annually, reflecting CSAs/outage scope; 2025 includes >$100M incremental Wind services deployment spend but still supports top-line growth.\n  - Pricing/backlog quality: Adjusted EBITDA margin trajectory assumes ongoing underwriting discipline and backlog mix tailwinds; quarterly cadence reflects normal H2 seasonality (higher execution).\n  - Segment and geography mix: Electrification’s share rises over time (Europe-heavy), Power grows modestly with services upgrades and data-center load, Wind stabilizes lower in 2026 before low-single-digit recovery with repowering.\n  - Orders/RPO: FY2025 orders set to ~50B with RPO building through execution; forward RPO growth assumes book-to-bill >1 in Electrification and ~1 in Power, with Wind flattish.\n- Limitations:\n  - No new drivers are introduced; only the six defined drivers are used. Quarterly geography and some quarterly segment/services splits were not disclosed in the provided context; where unavailable, quarterly history is shown only for disclosed quarters, and forecasts are presented with clear assumptions.\n  - Industry and TAM commentary inform directionality but do not substitute for undisclosed financial datapoints; where unit forecasts (wind/gas) are shown, they are directional and tied to disclosed trendlines/backlog stance, not official company guidance.\n- Risk sensitivities:\n  - Wind policy/tariff changes, execution/EPC capacity on HVDC, and schedule adherence can shift conversion timing; upside skew remains in Electrification backlog conversion and Power services upgrades; downside risk in offshore execution or policy-driven U.S. wind timing.\n\nIf you want this in an exportable model (CSV/Excel) with all series and formulas, I can produce it for you."

    "one": "Synthesis note\n- Demand/visibility: Grid-electrification is in a multi‑year upcycle with rising backlog and book‑to‑bill >1. Power remains the stabilizer via services; Wind is rebasing but showed improving throughput and late‑2024 profitability inflection.

FX is noisy quarter to quarter but a second‑order driver versus mix and volume.\n- Forecast posture: FY2025 reflects broad‑based growth led by Electrification and steady Power services, with Wind improving on better project conversion;

Wind rebounds from the 2024 dip; Gas new‑build relatively flat with services growth. TAM CAGR 2024–2029 around mid‑single‑digits supports company growth at similar or slightly higher rates in Electrification and steady in Power.\n- Segment mix\n  - FY2025: Electrification grows ~+21% on backlog conversion; Power +~7% led by services throughput; Wind +~6% on better project conversion versus FY2024. Out‑years taper toward mid‑ to high‑single‑digit growth for Electrification, low‑ to mid‑single‑digit for Power, and mid‑single‑digit for Wind.\n- Equipment vs. services\n  - Services outgrow equipment by ~1–2 pts over the cycle as installed base expands; quarterly seasonality preserved (Q4 heavier).\n- Orders/backlog\n  - Book‑to‑bill remains modestly above 1.0 in 2025–2027, sustaining RPO growth; conversion assumes no material cancellations and normal milestone timing.\n- FX\n  - FY2025 net headwind assumed given H1 actuals; neutral thereafter for planning.\n\nCaveats and scope limits\n- History coverage: Filed, company‑level actuals are available for FY2023–FY2024 and through 2025Q2; earlier years for these drivers are not provided in the context. Segment totals are pre‑elimination and therefore do not equal consolidated revenue (intersegment eliminations ~−$442M in FY2024).\n- Timing sensitivity: Quarterly forecasts reflect typical seasonality (Q4 stronger) and backlog conversion pacing; large project milestones can shift realized timing.\n- FX uncertainty: FX forecasts are placeholders for modeling; actual translation impact can diverge with currency moves and hedging outcomes.\n- Orders/RPO dynamics: RPO includes long‑duration service contracts; quarterly correlation to next‑quarter revenue is low. Forecast RPO assumes broadly stable customer financing conditions and no unusual terminations.\n- No new drivers introduced: Forecasts strictly cover the four drivers specified in the supplied context (segment mix; equipment/services mix; FX effect; orders/backlog conversion).",
    "two": "Synthesis note (context and cross-driver themes)\n- Electrification is the growth engine. Record RPO and a seller’s market in grid equipment make Electrification the clearest multiyear revenue accelerator; 2025YTD trends (+22.6% YoY in H1) support double‑digit growth through FY26, with some normalization thereafter.\n- Power is steady and resilient. Gas OE is capacity/slot constrained, but price/mix and a deep services annuity lift Power revenues steadily; services utilization and upgrade scope are the core monetization levers.\n- Wind is mixed. Onshore U.S. repowers and pricing discipline support revenue quality, but 2026 faces a potential onshore step‑down; Offshore execution is still the key risk to milestone conversion (timing) and profitability even as loss intensity moderates vs 2H24.\n- FX remains noise, not direction. Quarterly impacts can swing, but full‑year effects are typically modest vs operating drivers.\n\nAll figures in US Dollars (USD millions) unless noted.

Where earlier history was not disclosed, we present “as available” in line with instructions.\n  • All historical figures are from GEV filings (10‑K/10‑Q/8‑K). 2023 FY values for some items are the sum of reported quarters.\n\n- Forecast method\n  • Electrification: Backlog/RPO cadence (+44% YoY to $23.5B at YE24; >50% converts within two years) and H1’25 +22.6% YoY growth anchor a double‑digit FY25–FY26 growth path, normalizing thereafter as capacity and lead times ease.\n  • Power services: Mid‑single‑digit growth consistent with higher fleet utilization, pricing, and LTSA conversion; we model ~4% FY25 with slight deceleration.\n  • Power equipment and gas unit shipments: Capacity/slot discipline caps growth; we model FY25 equipment +~10% (H1’25 +16.7% YoY already realized), then low‑single‑digit thereafter; gas turbine units ~84 in FY25 tapering modestly thereafter.\n  • Wind: FY25 total revenue up low‑mid single‑digits (H1 +11% YoY; H2 modest YoY growth), then a FY26 step‑down reflecting management’s signaled order softness in 2025 and a potential 2026 onshore revenue dip; gradual recovery afterward.\n  • Offshore execution (Wind EBITDA proxy): Loss intensity moderates from 2H24 levels; risk of additional charges persists but expected to lessen through FY27 with normalized milestone conversion.\n\n- Seasonality and mix\n  • H2 weighting remains in equipment (Power and Wind). Services are steadier but still exhibit outage‑season patterns (Q4 often strongest).\n\n- FX treatment\n  • FX forecasts are conservative and near‑neutral at annual level; quarterly estimates are small directional placeholders, reflecting diversified currency mix and hedging.\n\n- Risks vs. opportunities\n  • Risks: Offshore execution/milestones, U.S. onshore policy/permitting timing, supply bottlenecks in transformers/HV equipment, potential easing of industry pricing power.\n  • Opportunities: Faster North America grid build (IRA-enabled), stronger baseload gas demand (data‑center loads), repower momentum in U.S. onshore, continued price/mix improvements and improved T&Cs across segments.\n\n- Consistency checks\n  • Quarterly forecasts extend the latest run‑rates and seasonality, producing FY25 outcomes that reconcile with H1 actuals and disclosed backlog conversion pacing.\n  • All dollar amounts are in USD; driver names and definitions are kept consistent with the provided context."

    "one": "Synthesis note (context and cadence)\n- Demand pull remains strong: orders run above revenue and RPO grows, led by Electrification backlog expansion, disciplined gas turbine slotting, and a de-risked Wind portfolio. 2024 orders $44.1B vs revenue $34.9B, YE24 RPO $119.0B; 1H25 orders $22.5B and RPO ≈$129.1B by Q2 (KPI’s: Total orders; KPI’s: Backlog).\n- Mix: 2024 revenue split was 54% equipment / 46% services; 1H25 leaned more equipment as gas deliveries accelerated, while services continued to grow mid-single digits (Income statement: Sales of equipment/services by quarter).\n- Forecast posture: Near term is equipment-heavy as backlog converts; medium term normalizes toward services growth.

2025Q1 10,152; 2025Q2 12,364 (KPI’s: Total orders).\n\nShort assumptions and caveats\n- Scope and data availability\n  - Standalone GEV disclosure is most complete from FY2023 onward; pre-2023 annuals are not available in the fundamental dataset used here. Historical sections therefore cover FY2023–FY2024 (as many as available) and the last four reported quarters (2024Q3–2025Q2).\n  - Wind Onshore/Offshore sub-revenues exclude Wind services; therefore Onshore+Offshore < total Wind.\n- Methodology\n  - FY2025 revenue anchored to management framing of ≈$37B; mix assumes equipment +~8% YoY and services +~4% YoY, consistent with 1H25 cadence and commentary that 1H skewed equipment while services continued to grow.\n  - FY2026–FY2029 growth rates: Electrification +12% CAGR (backlog, TAM, pricing), Power +5% CAGR (services annuity + new-unit slotting), Wind +5% CAGR (onshore price/mix; cautious offshore), equipment +7% and services +6% CAGRs. Orders +8% CAGR (TAM path); RPO rises with orders>revenue.\n  - Quarterly forecasts (Q0–Q3) apply recent seasonality patterns (2024) and YoY growth heuristics by segment; equipment/services split in 2H25 is scaled to hit FY25 mix targets.\n- FX and price/mix\n  - FX impacts are from reported “Less: foreign currency effect”; forward FX assumed modest/neutral absent guidance. Organic revenue YoY is used as a proxy for price/mix and volume; no explicit price-only series is disclosed.\n- Dependencies and execution\n  - Backlog conversion depends on EPC/permitting timelines, tariff pass-throughs, and supply chain execution (transformers/HVDC). Offshore execution remains a watch point; we hold FY25 offshore below FY24 levels in line with 1H25 run rate.\n  - Segment totals and consolidated equipment/services will not perfectly reconcile quarter-by-quarter due to intersegment eliminations and disclosure rounding; annual alignment is maintained to the consolidated frame.\n\nIf you want these series in a spreadsheet with formulas/seasonality drivers exposed, I can generate and share it.",
    "two": "Synthesis note\n- Cross-driver themes: Revenue resilience is anchored in Power services conversion and a growing consolidated RPO; Electrification continues to benefit from a seller’s market and elongated lead-times; Wind is stabilizing with selective onshore exposure and a repriced offshore pipeline, though 2026 onshore presents a softer setup. Mix continues to shift toward services and toward Power/Electrification relative to Wind.\n- Macro/market context: Grid modernization and AI/data-center load growth (U.S. and Europe) support Electrification orders and near-term backlog conversion. Gas power benefits from reliability/baseload needs and coal-to-gas shifts, sustaining a multi-year services upcycle. Wind volumes recover selectively with U.S.-skew and offshore repricing; 2026 onshore remains a caution year per management commentary.\n\nRevenue drivers used\n- Driver 1: Power services expansion and conversion of long-duration agreements\n- Driver 2: Wind equipment volume and onshore/offshore/repower unit mix\n- Driver 3: Orders growth and backlog/RPO conversion to revenue\n- Driver 4: Equipment vs. services revenue mix shift\n- Driver 5: Segment mix shift between Power, Wind, and Electrification\n\nAll historical figures are from GE Vernova filings (10‑K/10‑Q/8‑K) and the latest reported quarters through 2025Q2;

All available historicals for FY2023–FY2024 and 2025Q1–Q2 are taken from company filings.\n- Quarterly framing: “Last 4 quarters” are 2024Q3–2025Q2. Q0–Q3 forecasts are 2025Q3–2026Q2.\n- Power services forecasts: Mid‑single‑digit growth profile reflects stable CSA conversion and a ~$60–63B services RPO base exiting 2024/early 2025. Quarterly seasonality assumes stronger Q4 conversion.\n- Wind equipment and units: 2025 revenue and units assume stabilization after a soft 2025Q1 orders trough and better 2025Q2 intake; 2026 reflects management’s caution that onshore could be down ~10–15% vs 2025, offset later by offshore pipeline at repriced ASPs and continued repower/services.\n- Orders and RPO: 2025 orders ≈$50B and RPO up ≥$13B are consistent with management commentary; subsequent years build gradually with Electrification strength, moderated by Wind normalization. Intra‑year RPO points for 2025Q2 onward are estimates inferred from orders–revenue cadence.\n- Equipment vs. services: Mix shifts modestly toward services over the horizon as installed base grows and conversion rates remain strong.\n- Segment mix: Power and Electrification grow faster than Wind near term; Wind reaccelerates slowly as offshore repricing flows into deliveries and U.S. onshore visibility improves. Segment totals align to a ~US$37B 2025 revenue envelope, trending higher thereafter.\n- FX and inflation: Forecasts are on an organic, USD basis; tariff and supply-chain impacts are embedded qualitatively (e.g., 2025 tariff headwind) and may shift timing.\n- Uncertainties: Permitting and policy timing (U.S. wind/IRA, EU grid), offshore execution on legacy projects, and competitor capacity additions could alter price/mix and backlog conversion.\n\nIf you want these forecasts delivered in a spreadsheet with formulas and sources for each line, I can generate it."

    "one": "Below is a focused, model-based revenue-driver forecast for GE Vernova (GEV), grounded in the provided filings context (through 2Q25) and the TAM/outlook framing. It covers only the five core revenue drivers from the context: segment mix, equipment-versus-services mix, orders/backlog conversion, wind volume/mix, and pricing/FX. Dollar figures are US$; forecasts are explicit about assumptions.\n\n1) Synthesis (themes and catalysts)\n- Electrification-led acceleration, Power resilience, Wind normalization. 2024 TAM stepped up on grids; 1H25 revenue growth (+10.8% YoY) and RPO expansion (to ~$128.7B in 2Q25) point to sustained conversion into revenue. Power’s services base and disciplined equipment slots underpin steady growth. Electrification should outgrow the company average as capacity ramps into strong demand (utilities, HVDC, hyperscalers). Wind is stabilizing: Onshore mix and repower density help; Offshore is a controlled burn-down (no new backlog unless repriced).\n- Mix matters. Services mix should trend modestly higher over the medium term, but 2025 equipment growth outpaces services (electrification and wind equipment deliveries), nudging the mix slightly toward equipment near term before drifting back to services.\n- Macro context. TAM is policy/infra driven more than GDP/oil over 2015–2024. To 2030, grids remain the center of gravity; gas supports reliability (services pull-through); wind’s growth is more volatile and regionally skewed (China-heavy onshore).\n\n2) Driver 1 — Segment Mix (Power, Wind, Electrification)\nAnnual (history and forecast: FY23–FY24 actuals; FY25–FY29 forecast)\n- FY23 (actual, sum of quarters): Total $33,239m; Power $17,436m; Wind $9,826m; Electrification $6,118m.\n- FY24 (actual): Total $34,935m; Power $18,127m; Wind $9,701m; Electrification $7,550m.\n- FY25 (FY0, forecast): Total ~$38,500m; Power ~$19,300m; Wind ~$10,250m; Electrification ~$8,950m.\n- FY26 (FY1, forecast): Total ~$40,565m; Power ~$20,265m; Wind ~$10,455m; Electrification ~$9,845m.\n- FY27 (FY2, forecast): Total ~$42,778m; Power ~$21,278m; Wind ~$10,769m; Electrification ~$10,731m.\n- FY28 (FY3, forecast): Total ~$45,131m; Power ~$22,342m; Wind ~$11,200m; Electrification ~$11,589m.\n- FY29 (FY4, forecast): Total ~$47,508m; Power ~$23,459m; Wind ~$11,648m; Electrification ~$12,401m.\nKey assumptions: 2025 Power +6–7% (services depth), Electrification high-teens growth (capacity ramp, hyperscaler/grid pull), Wind mid-single-digit growth (onshore/repower offsetting Offshore burn).

FX near-neutral in aggregate for the year (quarterly puts/takes net roughly flat).\n- FY25 (FY0, forecast): Price tailwind broadly positive; model assumption: Power +~2% price/mix, Electrification +~3%, Wind +~1%; FX modest net headwind (~-$25m full-year).\n- FY26–FY29 (forecast): Price/mix positive but gradually normalizing; FX assumed neutral over the cycle (project-level hedging; geographic mix).\n\nQuarterly FX (total revenue; last 4 history; next 4 forecast)\n- History (Q-4 to Q-1): 3Q24 -$8m; 4Q24 -$35m; 1Q25 -$129m; 2Q25 +$66m.\n- Forecast (Q0 to Q3): 3Q25 -$25m; 4Q25 $0m; 1Q26 +$25m; 2Q26 +$25m.\n\nQuarterly price (qualitative targets; next 4 forecast)\n- 3Q25–4Q25: Price/mix positive across segments (Power ~+2% YoY; Electrification ~+3%; Wind ~+1%).\n- 1Q26–2Q26: Price/mix remains positive (Power ~+1.5%; Electrification ~+2.5%; Wind ~+1%).\nNote: Price contributions reflect backlog repricing and underwriting discipline; exact price/FX splits are not fully disclosed quarterly and are presented as modeled assumptions.\n\n3) Short assumptions and caveats\n- Scope and drivers: Only the five drivers from the provided context are included: (1) segment mix; (2) equipment vs. services mix; (3) orders and backlog (RPO) conversion; (4) wind volume/mix; (5) pricing and FX. No additional drivers are introduced.\n- Data availability limits: FY-level history pre-FY23 is not available for GEV as a standalone in the provided context; quarterly segment splits for 3Q/4Q24, and quarterly total equipment/services for 3Q/4Q24, were not disclosed. Where quarterly values are missing, we do not fabricate history.\n- Forecast method: Forecasts are anchored to reported 2024 actuals, 1H25 actuals, sequential orders/RPO trends, TAM narratives (electrification upshift; steady gas; normalized wind), seasonality observed in 2023–2024, and management’s discipline on pricing/backlog. Pricing and FX contributions are modeled as conservative ranges consistent with management commentary (positive price, episodic FX).\n- Consistency checks: FY25 totals are constructed to align with 1H25 momentum (+10.8% YoY) and typical H2 seasonal uplift. Services mix dips slightly in FY25 (equipment-led growth), then trends up with installed base. Wind sub-mix assumes Offshore backlog burn through ~2026 and growing repower intensity.\n- Sensitivities: Electrification capacity/lead-times and HVDC execution; Offshore timing and residual provisions; onshore permitting and interconnection queues; FX volatility; policy/tariff shifts. These can alter quarterly phasing and annual levels, especially in Wind and Electrification equipment.\n- Currency: All figures in US dollars. FX effects represent the “reported revenue foreign currency effect” line in context; price contributions are modeled and directional.\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver these forecasts as machine-readable tables (CSV/Excel) or add scenario bands (base/upside/downside) around the FY25–FY29 trajectory for each driver.",
    "two": "Synthesis note\n- Electrification remains the primary growth engine (double‑digit), supported by expanding RPO and premium pricing; Power equipment is in a durable up‑cycle, while Power services continue to compound steadily with price and outage scope. Wind equipment remains lumpy near term (offshore execution, onshore selectivity) with 2026 softer before modest stabilization thereafter. FX is a minor top‑line factor vs these drivers and mostly a quarterly optical swing.\n- Quarterly cadence: services and grid tend to skew to Q2/Q4; modeling preserves that seasonality for Q0–Q3.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts (USD millions).

No new drivers are introduced.\n- Seasonality: Q2/Q4 are seasonally stronger for services and grid; Q0–Q3 quarterly forecasts allocate H2 using prior‑year H2 mix shares (clearly labeled as modeled).\n- Electrification quarterly history: 2024Q1 and Q2 used reported YoY growth and quarterly amounts (Q2 $1.79B; Q1 +24% YoY), and 2024Q3 used +22% YoY; 2024Q4 was derived as FY24 minus Q1–Q3. All such items are explicitly labeled as calculations.\n- Wind/Power equipment quarterly history: Where a quarter’s split was not directly tabulated in the press release, values were taken from 10‑Q segment tables; for 2024Q3 Wind equipment, equipment = total − services, per 10‑Q.\n- FX: Quarterly FX effects are disclosed for 2025Q1 and Q2; 2024Q3/Q4 FX at the revenue line were not found in the filings set we used. We therefore model small, mean‑reverting effects forward and refrain from backfilling missing quarterlies.\n- Forecast horizon: Annual FY0–FY4 and quarterly Q0–Q3 use explicit growth assumptions tied to management commentary (Electrification mid‑high‑teens; Power equipment up on slot scarcity; Wind equipment down in 2026 then stabilizing; services high‑single‑digit). These are not company guidance and should be treated as analyst estimates.\n- Currency: All figures are in US dollars, consistent with the filings.\n- Reconciliation to total company revenue: Drivers are not mutually exclusive to the company P&L (e.g., services is consolidated; equipment by segment is a subset). The goal is to forecast core driver trajectories, not to sum to consolidated revenue.\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver these as a spreadsheet and add waterfall checks (e.g., H2 allocations reconcile to the annual forecast per driver) and sensitivity toggles for Electrification growth (mid vs high‑teens) and Wind 2026 decline (−10%/−12%/−15%)."

    "two": "Synthesis note (optional)\n- Momentum is supported by Electrification backlog growth and a multi‑year Power upcycle (AI/data-center load, firm capacity, upgrades). Services remain the stabilizer and primary compounder; equipment dollars rise on price/mix despite mixed unit trends. Wind normalizes with improving services and selective new units. Backlog growth outpaces revenue, underpinning visibility.

Segment revenues (2023–2024), equipment/services (2023–2024), unit volumes (2023–2025H1), orders (2023–2024), and RPO (2024Q4–2025Q1) are as cited; all figures in US dollars.\n- Limited standalone history: As a newly listed carve‑out, standalone quarterly detail prior to 2025Q1 is not comprehensively available in this dataset. Where the instruction requests “last 4 quarters,” I provide the latest available (2025Q1–Q2 actuals) and forecast the next two quarters; earlier quarters are not shown where not disclosed.\n- Forecast anchoring: FY 2025 consolidated revenue is anchored to management framing (~$37B). Segment growth: Power +6% YoY on services strength; Electrification +16% on backlog conversion; Wind -6% on selective intake and offshore burn-down. Out-years reflect: Electrification high single-digit CAGR, Power low-to-mid single-digit CAGR, Wind ~flat-to-slightly up as offshore normalizes and onshore remains selective.\n- Price/mix: Continue positive in Power and Electrification; Wind price/mix stable to modestly positive with larger platforms and repower mix; offshore scope remains lumpy.\n- Orders/backlog: 2025 orders ~ $50B and year-end RPO ≥ $132B follow management commentary; out-year orders/RPO glide reflect TAM growth and capacity discipline (particularly in Power).\n- FX: 2025 full-year headwind set conservatively (-$150m); held neutral thereafter due to lack of visibility. Historical quarterly FX effects beyond 2025Q1 were not available in the dataset and are not imputed.\n- Eliminations: Segment totals differ from consolidated revenue due to intersegment eliminations and other adjustments (e.g., -$442m in FY 2024). Equipment/services forecasts are set on consolidated totals and may not exactly tie to the sum of segment-level forecasts in each period.\n- Offshore/onshore split: Annual 2023–2024 actuals per filings; 2025–2029 split assumes offshore declines as legacy projects execute and onshore share rises toward ~90% by 2029. Quarterly split is applied proportionally to the wind total for H2 2025 as disclosure for H1 2025 split was not provided.\n- Dependencies: Execution timing, customer delivery schedules, permitting, and project acceptances can shift quarterly phasing, especially in Electrification and Wind (offshore).\n\nIf you want these forecasts delivered in a machine-readable spreadsheet with formulas and a sensitivity toggle (e.g., alternative growth/FX cases), I can provide that next.",
    "two": "Optional synthesis note\n- The revenue trajectory is increasingly anchored by Power services and Electrification conversion from a rapidly expanding backlog, while Wind remains selective with offshore execution still a gating factor near term. Backlog and RPO provide multi-year visibility; pricing/terms discipline and a “gas higher for longer” backdrop support stability. Electrification should outgrow the portfolio as transmission/HVDC/transformer capacity expands to meet AI/data-center and electrification loads.

2026Q1E: 0; 2026Q2E: 0\n- Organic revenue (contextual)\n  - 2024A organic growth: Electrification +18%, Power +7%, Wind -1% (company tags). For 2025, our forecasts implicitly assume low-teens organic growth in Electrification, mid-single-digit in Power, and low-single-digit decline in Wind (stabilizing by 2026).\n\nWhat’s driving the forecasts\n- Equipment volumes and mix: Gas turbine deliveries pace in 1H25 (19 and 21 units; 3.0 GW and 5.2 GW) supports a higher FY25 unit/GW outcome vs 2024, with disciplined slotting and price/mix. Wind units remain volatile; we model lower FY25 deliveries vs 2024, stabilizing thereafter.\n- Services scale and attach: Power services remain the annuity anchor (2024: $12.4B; ~68% of Power revenue), rising to ~70% mix by 2027 as utilization and scope increase. Wind services grow gradually with installed base, constrained near-term by offshore remediation/availability.\n- Segment mix: Electrification accelerates from $7.55B (2024) with strong RPO/orders and extended lead times; Power steady growth on services; Wind down mid-single digits in 2025, then recovers modestly.\n- Orders/backlog: Orders grow mid- to high-single digits from $44.1B (2024) as grid and gas cycles remain firm; adjusted backlog builds from $119.0B (2024YE) to ~$130B (2025YE).\n- FX: Modeled near-flat as reported 2024 FX was de minimis (-$6M) relative to total revenues.\n\nKey source datapoints grounding the history (citations embedded in context you provided)\n- Segment revenues 2024: Power $18,127; Wind $9,701; Electrification $7,550 (10-K | Segmental breakdown | Total | 2024FY)\n- Services and equipment totals 2024: Services $15,983; Equipment $18,952 (8-K | Income statement | Sales of services/equipment | 2024FY)\n- 2023 quarterly builds for segment and equipment/services (10-Q/8-K tags cited in context)\n- Units delivered: 2024 gas turbines 75 (11.9 GW); 2024 wind turbines 1,778; 2025Q1–Q2 gas 19/21 units (3.0/5.2 GW); wind 276/351 units\n- Orders and backlog: 2024FY orders $44,107; Adjusted backlog 2024Q4 $119,023; 2025Q1 $123,438; Power RPO 2024Q4 $73,351; 2025Q1 $76,292\n- FX effect: 2024FY -$6; 2024Q4 -$35; 2023Q1–Q4 [-8, -7, -20, +109]\n\nAssumptions and caveats\n- Coverage scope and drivers: Only the disclosed drivers are modeled: equipment volumes/mix (units, GW, equipment revenue), services scale/attach (segment services, services mix, RPO), segment mix (segment revenues), orders/backlog, and FX/organic revenue. No new drivers introduced.\n- History limits: Standalone GEV annual history in the structured set begins in 2023 (assembled from quarters) and 2024 (full-year). The “last 5 fiscal years” are shown as far back as available. Quarterly “last 4” history is provided where disclosed; some 2024 quarterly sub-series are not available in the dataset and are labeled N/A rather than estimated.\n- Forecast method: Bottom-up by driver using: (i) disclosed 2023–2025 actuals; (ii) management commentary on segment trends (Electrification outgrowth, Power services stability, Wind near-term deceleration); (iii) backlog/RPO path and order cadence; and (iv) market framing (“gas higher for longer,” grid capacity constraints). Segment growth and mix assumptions are stated; services mix for Power steps toward ~70%.\n- Seasonality and timing: Quarterly forecasts reflect typical 2H strength in project deliveries and services outages, but the exact conversion of RPO can shift between quarters on execution timing.\n- Wind execution: Forecasts assume offshore contract losses diminish through 2026 as legacy projects substantially complete; onshore U.S. repower remains a bright spot. If offshore remediation extends or new losses emerge, Wind equipment/services could undershoot.\n- FX and macro: FX assumed near-neutral beyond 2025; macro/policy/tariff swings can alter orders timing and revenue recognition. Where filings provided “organic” growth, we used those as directional anchors; forward organic growth is modeled, not guided.\n- Currency: All amounts are US dollars as requested.\n\nIf you want, I can deliver these forecasts as a spreadsheet with separate tabs for each driver (annual and quarterly) and a parameter block to sensitize growth/mix and backlog conversion rates."

    "one": "Synthesis note (optional)\n- Cross-driver themes: Backlog conversion and services annuity underpin near-term visibility, while Electrification continues to outgrow the portfolio and Power rides a “higher-for-longer” gas cycle. Wind remains selective: onshore resilient but policy-sensitive; offshore executes legacy backlog with disciplined new intake. Across 2H25–2026, we expect orders to stay >1x book-to-bill, services mix to keep inching higher, and Electrification to carry the growth baton as grid capacity constraints persist.\n- Macro context: Grid bottlenecks and firming needs for AI/data-center load support Power and Electrification; wind demand normalizes at healthier pricing after the 2022–2024 reset.

Unit metrics (units, GW) are physical, not currency.\n- Risk sensitivities:\n  - Adverse policy/tariff moves (especially onshore wind), offshore execution timing, HVDC/transformer lead times, and FX swings can shift quarterly cadence. Orders can be lumpy; book-to-bill ratios by quarter should be read with that context.\n- Data provenance:\n  - Historical numbers match the cited GEV filings/KPIs in the provided context (e.g., FY2024 revenue $34,935M; FY2024 orders $44,107M; FY2024 RPO $119,023M; 2025Q2 revenue $9,111M; orders $12,364M; FX +$66M).

    "two": "Below are revenue-driver forecasts for GE Vernova (GEV), grounded in the latest reported data (through 2025Q2) and management’s recent commentary. I only cover the five core drivers specified in your context: Services vs. Equipment mix; Segment mix (Power, Wind, Electrification); Orders and backlog (RPO) conversion; Wind equipment volume (turbines and repower GW); Pricing and FX.\n\nSynthesis note (brief)\n- Mix and visibility: 2025 growth is broad-based (equipment and services both up). Electrification continues to outgrow the enterprise, and Power services remain a high-visibility annuity. The 2026 onshore wind downtick (−10–15% vs. 2025) is embedded in forecasts via lower Wind equipment volume and revenue, partially offset by Electrification and Power.\n- Capacity, pricing, and backlog: Power maintains discipline (slot scarcity, 20 GW/yr equipment cap), services are expanding, and Electrification backlog is compounding (seller’s market in grid hardware). Pricing remains supportive, while FX is modeled as a small tailwind/neutral.\n- Quarterly cadence: Q4 is the seasonally strongest; Q1 tends to be the softest. Near-term: Q3/Q4 2025 equipment ramps and services hold firm; 1H 2026 reflects softer Wind before normalization.\n\nDriver 1) Services vs. Equipment Mix (USD millions; mix = share of total revenue)\n- Annual\n  - FY2023 (actual): Services 14,981 (45.1%);

some RPO/backlog breakouts are only available at select quarter-ends. Where filings did not provide a figure for earlier years/quarters, the item is omitted rather than estimated.\n- Forecast methodology:\n  - Top-down alignment to reported run-rates and seasonality (Q4 strongest, Q1 softer).\n  - Segment assumptions: Electrification double-digit growth (backlog conversion), Power mid-single-digit growth (services strength), Wind down in 2026 (−12% midpoint vs. 2025) then gradual recovery.\n  - Services vs. equipment: services mid-single-digit growth anchored by CSAs and transactional; equipment ramps in 2025 on Wind/Power deliveries, normalizes in 2026, then modest growth.\n  - Pricing: modest positive uplift (assumed +2% services/+1% equipment in 2025; +1–2% annually thereafter). Pricing is not directly disclosed as a standalone line; it is embedded in segment/equipment/services forecasts.\n  - FX: treated as a small tailwind/neutral after 2025; quarterly FX forecasts are placeholders to reflect low sensitivity vs. volume/mix.\n- Dependencies and risks:\n  - Wind: execution on legacy offshore contracts, onshore policy/tariffs, and interconnection timing in the U.S.\n  - Electrification: factory throughput, supply chain, and sovereign/utility program timing; pricing discipline vs. European affordability constraints.\n  - Power: outage cadence, LTSA scope, and gas equipment slot allocation (20 GW/yr cap supports pricing).\n  - Macro/FX: rates, CPI, and USD path could shift orders timing and FX realization; modeled as second-order vs. mix/volume.\n\nIf you want these forecasts in a spreadsheet with formulas and cross-driver reconciliation checks (e.g., tying orders/RPO to revenue conversion), I can generate and share a file."

Where earlier-year history is not available in the standalone GEV dataset, I include all available years. Currency: US dollars. Units for equipment volumes are GW.\n\n1) Synthesis (themes and catalysts)\n- Electrification is the growth engine: grid build-outs and long lead times support double‑digit Electrification revenue growth and a higher share of company revenue vs. 2023.\n- Power remains resilient via services: the vast gas installed base and higher utilization support steady mid‑single to high‑single digit services growth and rising outage scope.\n- Wind normalizes from reset: Onshore price/mix and services improve; offshore is curated. Expect a gradual, healthier rebuild, not a snap-back.\n- Orders > billings sustains RPO: Book‑to‑bill above 1.0x likely persists into 2026 on backlog strength, then trends toward steady-state as deliveries accelerate.\n- Macro shaping the path: Data-center load, transmission constraints, and firming capacity needs lift Electrification and Power; FX remains a second-order factor.\n\n2) Annual: last available history, then FY0–FY4 forecast\nDriver A.

Earlier years are not presented to avoid mixing non-comparable pre-spin bases.\n- Orders/backlog math: Forward RPO is approximated as prior RPO + orders − revenue; ignores minor FX/contract adjustments, cancellations, or reclassifications. Quarterly book‑to‑bill uses the corresponding quarterly total revenue as the denominator.\n- Growth calibration:\n  - Services: Mid‑single to high‑single digit growth anchored to installed base and utilization; mix remains ~44–46% over the horizon, dipping near term as equipment cycles are strong.\n  - Electrification: Double‑digit near-term growth consistent with backlog expansion and seller’s market; moderates over time as capacity scales.\n  - Power: High‑single digit in 2025 then mid‑single digit, balanced between equipment deliveries and services growth.\n  - Wind: Gradual recovery on repricing and cost/quality actions; no aggressive snap-back assumed.\n- Equipment volumes: 2025–2029 GW paths align with an “>40 GW” global HDGT market near term and a healthier wind cycle under repriced economics. Quarterly distribution reflects typical Q4 weighting.\n- FX: Treated as a second‑order driver; baseline near zero over the medium term with small quarterly noise.\n- Sources: All historical figures above are taken from GE Vernova’s filings dataset (income statement, segment disaggregation, KPI order/backlog and shipment GW, FX effect), including 2024FY results and quarterly 2023–2025 data points; forecasts are analyst estimates consistent with those disclosures and stated market context.\n- Not guidance: Forecasts are independent analyst estimates for planning purposes, not company guidance. Key risks include wind execution on legacy projects, permitting/tariffs, supply-chain costs, and timing of large grid awards; upside from Electrification awards, services upgrades, and data-center load growth.\n\nIf you want, I can deliver these forecasts in a spreadsheet with formulas tying the quarterly and annual roll-ups.",
    "two": "Below is a revenue-driver forecast for GE Vernova (ticker: GEV) using only the five core drivers in the provided context. I anchor history in the company’s last reported actuals and the most recent quarterly disclosures and then provide a transparent, assumptions-based outlook. All figures are in US dollars. Where quarterly or annual splits are not disclosed, I either (i) use the closest disclosed proxy clearly labeled, or (ii) mark “ND” (not disclosed). Forecasts are explicitly assumptions-based and aligned to backlog, order cadence, and management commentary cited in context.\n\nSynthesis note (themes and catalysts)\n- Demand visibility is durable: company RPO/backlog remains elevated (>$135B as of 3Q25), with Electrification the fastest-growing engine and Power services a long-duration annuity. Backlog depth underpins revenue conversion into FY25–FY27.\n- Grid upcycle and firming capacity: Electrification is benefitting from a “seller’s market” (lead times into 2028–2029), while Power equipment + services are supported by gas capacity needs (AI/data center load) and a growing upgrades pipeline. Together they shape price/mix positively.\n- Wind stabilizing with better execution: onshore pricing/selectivity and services/repower help; offshore remains a paced conversion. Quarterly wind revenue improved in 2025, but cadence remains timing-sensitive.\n- Mix and FX: Pricing remains positive in Power and Electrification; FX introduces quarterly noise but has been modest at full-year scale.\n\nDriver 1 — Services expansion and mix within the installed base\nDefinition tracked: Total “Sales of services” (company-level).

Q4 seasonality persists. Risks: CSA estimate changes; outage timing.\n- Electrification equipment growth\n  - FY2025 equipment +~30% (vs 2024) anchored by rising backlog and strong 2H shipment cadence; growth moderates thereafter as capacity/supply constraints ease but remains above grid capex growth due to backlog conversion and HVDC programs.\n- Wind volume/revenue\n  - FY2025: modest equipment recovery (+~3%) with improved execution; services mix helps; offshore is paced. Medium-term: gradual volume rebound as U.S. interconnection improves; repowering/services support steady growth.\n- Orders/backlog\n  - FY2025 orders at ~$50B supported by Power equipment (gas >40 GW market, SRAs converting) and Electrification mega-programs; RPO builds to ~$138B (Electrification + Power services lead). Out-year growth steady but throttled by capacity/underwriting discipline.\n- Pricing/mix and FX\n  - Pricing remains positive in Power and Electrification; FX modeled neutral at the full-year level though quarterly variability persists.\n\nCaveats and scope limits\n- Data availability: Driver-level annual history prior to 2023 is limited in public carve-out disclosures. Where unavailable, items are marked ND; no numbers are fabricated.\n- Quarterly proxies: For Electrification in quarters where equipment split is not disclosed, total Electrification segment revenue is used as a proxy for the equipment growth cadence; equipment is the dominant growth component per filings.\n- Wind quarterly details: Unit counts are provided only where disclosed; otherwise, the wind total revenue line is used to evidence cycle shape.\n- FX modeling: Forward FX effects are held neutral at the annual level and small at the quarterly level; actuals can vary meaningfully by quarter.\n- Execution and policy timing: Wind conversion cadence, tariffs, and U.S. permitting/interconnection can shift quarterly shapes; Power equipment shipments are gated by OEM/EPC capacity and slotting.\n- All forecasts are assumptions-based and anchored to backlog/orders trends and management context; they are not company guidance.\n\nThis forecast set maintains consistent driver naming, aligns with the historical run-rate and mix trends visible in the data, and translates the current backlog/order momentum into a reasonable, capacity- and execution-aware glidepath across both annual and quarterly horizons."

Electrification demand is structurally tight (rising backlog), Power remains healthy, and Wind is stabilizing with an execution-first posture offshore and improving onshore mix.\n- Catalysts: Electrification backlog expansion; continued gas equipment and services strength; normalized offshore terms; and rising grid spend driven by data center and electrification load growth. Orders remain a leading indicator for revenue conversion over the next 4–6 quarters.\n- Macro/market: Management’s TAM anchors imply high-single-digit market growth through 2030; execution and permitting remain the main swing factors in Wind;

No 10-year historical series by segment/driver is disclosed; forecasts anchor to the latest filings, orders, and backlog levels.\n- Orders/backlog conversion: Quarterly orders conversion to revenue is lumpy and project-dependent; we model seasonality (stronger in 2H) and assume book-to-bill ≈1x to slightly above through FY2026–FY2029.\n- Services trajectory: Modeled mid/high-single-digit growth on installed-base utilization and attachment; a fleet-wide reliability event would be a downside risk.\n- Wind execution: Forecast assumes no new uneconomic offshore awards, gradual offshore backlog burn through 2026, and onshore/repower/services mix improvement; unit GW orders recover gradually as industry repricing takes hold.\n- Electrification: Backlog continues to expand from tight markets (transformers/HVDC), supporting double-digit Electrification revenue growth in the near term, moderating later.\n- FX: Treated as neutral over a full year after a de minimis FY2024 impact; quarterly swings remain possible.\n- Consolidation note: Segment totals won’t equal consolidated revenue due to intersegment eliminations and “other”; Equipment + Services equals consolidated revenue.\n- Quarterly forecast convention: Q0–Q3 is presented as the four quarters following the latest actual quarter (2025Q2). That is, Q0=2025Q3, then 2025Q4, 2026Q1, 2026Q2.\n\nSources basis (selected fields)\n- Total revenues, Sales of equipment, Sales of services: 2023Q1–2025Q2 (10-Q/8-K)\n- Total orders (quarterly/annual): 2023–2025Q2 (Others/8-K/10-Q)\n- Backlog/RPO: 2024Q4, 2025Q1 (Others | KPI’s | Backlog)\n- Segment totals (Power, Wind, Electrification): 2023Q1–2025Q2 (10-Q/8-K)\n- FX effect: 2023Q1–2025Q2 (8-K | KPI’s | Organic revenue by segment | Total revenues | Less: foreign currency effect)\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver these forecasts as a CSV or Excel with linked formulas for quick sensitivity testing (e.g., services CAGR ±200 bps, orders growth ±100 bps, wind GW path).",
    "two": "Synthesis note (context and cross-driver themes)\n- Demand backdrop: TAM expands at ≈8.6% CAGR through 2030, with Electrification the fastest-growing component; Power (gas) is in a multi-year upcycle with slot scarcity and positive pricing; Wind is mixed—structural long-term growth but near-term onshore softness (policy/tariffs, permitting).\n- Backlog visibility: Orders outpace revenue in 2024–2025; RPO rose from $119.0B (YE24) to $123.4B (Q1’25) and is set to build further in 2H’25+; this supports multi-quarter revenue conversion, especially in Power services and Electrification projects.\n- Mix implications: Services growth and pricing power (especially in Power) are steady revenue levers; Electrification backlog growth creates multi-year equipment conversion; Wind remains the most cyclical near term (management expects 2026 onshore down 10–15% vs 2025) but service/repower supports medium-term stability.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts (all figures in USD millions unless noted)\n\n1) Equipment volume (Sales of equipment)\n- Annual\n  - FY2023: 18,258\n  - FY2024: 18,952\n  - FY2025E (FY0): 19,795\n  - FY2026E (FY1): 20,250\n  - FY2027E (FY2): 21,144\n  - FY2028E (FY3): 22,128\n  - FY2029E (FY4): 23,311\n- Quarterly\n  - History (Q-4 to Q-1): 2024Q3 5,290;

Services grow mid-to-high single digits through the horizon on installed-base utilization and attach; equipment grows modestly in 2025 and 2027–2029, with a 2026 onshore wind dip offset by Power/Electrification.\n- Orders/backlog: 2025 orders ~50B; RPO grows to ~134B by YE25 (≥+13B YoY). Thereafter, orders grow mid-single to high-single digits, and RPO builds by ~7–10B annually as orders exceed revenue. Quarterly RPO forecasts are modeled as prior RPO + orders – revenue (plus observed Q1’25 adjustment to match disclosed RPO).\n- Pricing/mix: Positive price in Power and Electrification persists; Electrification organic growth remains strongest given the segment’s backlog momentum and capacity constraints in HV equipment/HVDC. Wind organic growth negative in 2026, stabilizing thereafter; segment margins improve gradually from negative territory.\n- FX: Treated as immaterial at the annual level (net ~0) despite quarterly volatility; 2H’25 modeled to offset 1H’25’s headwind.\n- Seasonality: Q4 remains the seasonal peak; H1 ~46–47% of full-year revenue based on recent cadence. H2’25 equipment/services allocated to hit FY25 targets consistent with 1H’25 actuals.\n\nCaveats and scope limits\n- Data availability: The earliest complete fiscal-year actuals in the provided dataset begin in FY2023. Where quarterly historical detail (e.g., 2024Q4 equipment/services; 2024Q3 company orders; 2025Q2 RPO) was not disclosed in the provided context, values are indicated as “n/a”.\n- Forecast method: Annual and quarterly forecasts are derived from disclosed 2023–2024 actuals, 1H’25 actuals, and management commentary (e.g., 2025 orders ≈$50B; backlog growth ≥$13B), combined with backlog-conversion math and observed seasonality. They are not company guidance.\n- Sensitivities: Wind execution, U.S. policy/tariffs, European grid affordability, and supply-chain constraints (e.g., transformers/HVDC capacity) can shift timing of orders and backlog conversion. FX can be volatile intra-year even if net annual effects are small.\n- Units and rounding: All dollars in USD; figures rounded to nearest million; percentage metrics rounded to the nearest 0.1–1.0 pp where appropriate.\n\nSources (from provided context)\n- 2024 revenues by segment and total; 2023 quarterly totals; 2024 equipment/services totals; orders; RPO; quarterly FX; 2025H1 equipment/services, orders, FX; quarterly and segment margins; management commentary on 2025 orders/revenue/backlog; Electrification TAM and backlog trajectory."

Where the company does not disclose a given quarterly detail (e.g., quarterly geography mix; certain quarter-by-quarter segment totals; some quarterly wind/gas volumes), I do not backfill with estimates.\n- FY25 anchor: Forecasts are constrained to management’s indicated 2025 revenue outlook (~$37B) and ~+$50B orders; H2’25 allocations reflect typical seasonality (Q4 strongest) and segment dynamics (Power services resilience, Electrification growth, Wind delivery cadence).\n- Electrification: Assumes sustained double-digit growth but moderating from H1’25’s +22.6% YoY to high-teens/low-20s for FY25–FY27, then normalizing to high-single/low-double digits through FY29. Backlog conversion remains healthy; large-project execution risk persists (HVDC/EPC).\n- Power: Assumes services-led mid-single-digit growth and tight OEM capacity (discipline around ~20 GW/year) supporting pricing; gas units/GW volume rising modestly, but services remain the primary revenue driver.\n- Wind: Assumes FY25 deliveries roughly flat-to-slightly up vs. 2024 on backlog conversion; 2026 onshore revenue softness (-10% to -15%) embedded as a lower volume year; gradual recovery thereafter with services improving mix. Offshore execution remains a key risk.\n- Orders/RPO: Book‑to‑bill stays >1.0 through the horizon; RPO grows gradually as orders exceed revenue. Backlog levels are rounded and intended as order‑of‑magnitude anchors consistent with FY revenue/ordering cadence.\n- Geographic mix: Only annual 2024 split is disclosed in the context. Quarterly geographic mix is not disclosed; forecasts therefore provide annual directional mix only (modest U.S. share uptick with NA grid/gas).\n- FX/tariffs: FX is treated as a second‑order effect (per disclosed “foreign currency effect” magnitudes). 2025 tariff/inflation headwind (~$300–$400m) is acknowledged qualitatively, with mitigation actions; forecasts implicitly net these impacts at the consolidated level.\n- Reconciliation: Quarterly forecasts by segment and mix are internally consistent with the annual totals but remain estimates given undisclosed quarterly splits in some areas. All forecasts are subject to change as the company updates orders, backlog, and execution timing.\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver these as structured tables (CSV or XLSX) and a waterfall showing how FY25–FY29 build up from the disclosed 2024 base, with sensitivity ranges by driver (orders-to-revenue conversion, Electrification growth, Wind delivery paths).",
    "two": "Synthesis note (context through 2025Q2 actuals)\n- Electrification and Power are the structurally growing engines: grid scarcity, HV equipment lead-times and AI/data center load keep orders and backlog elevated; Power services remain a durable annuity. Wind is managed selectively; onshore is U.S.-weighted with IRA tailwinds while offshore is executed with tight underwriting. Pricing stays “price positive,” FX is a low-impact swing factor.\n- Forecast spine: equipment growth is led by Electrification and steady gas equipment; services growth compounds off a large Power LTSA base; Wind equipment moderates into 2026 (management has guided 2026 onshore revenue down 10–15% vs 2025), then stabilizes. Orders continue to outpace revenue, keeping RPO rising. FX assumed net-neutral over the medium term.\n\nDrivers in scope (exactly as in context)\n1) Equipment volume (Sales of equipment)\n2) Services revenue growth (Sales of services)\n3) Pricing/FX (Less: foreign currency effect on total revenues)\n4) Orders and backlog conversion (Total orders;

Where quarterly geography is not disclosed, we use annual mix as a proxy (clearly labeled).\n- Forecast method: Bottom-up continuation from reported trends and management commentary:\n  - Electrification equipment/services: backlog-led conversion; NA fastest growth; assumed mid- to high-single-digit 2025–2027 growth, moderating thereafter.\n  - Power: steady new-unit cadence and services uplift; services growth low-to-mid single digit; equipment mid-single-digit over cycle.\n  - Wind: disciplined onshore, selective offshore execution; assumed 2026 onshore revenue down ~10–15% vs 2025, then stabilization.\n  - Pricing stays “price positive”; FX net-neutral from 2026 onward (quarterly noise possible).\n- Limitations:\n  - GE Vernova standalone historical financials before 2023 are not fully available in the dataset; therefore, “last 5 fiscal years” history is truncated to 2023–2024 for numeric detail.\n  - Quarterly RPO beyond 2025Q1 not available in filings captured here; we provide annual RPO forecasts and quarterly Total orders instead as the conversion indicator.\n  - Quarterly geography is not disclosed; quarterly geographic mixes shown for history are proxies based on the latest annual mix.\n- Sensitivities:\n  - Wind execution (offshore) and onshore policy/tariffs into 2026 could shift equipment cadence meaningfully.\n  - Electrification delivery schedules (HVDC/transformers) and factory ramps affect quarterly phasing; EPC bottlenecks in Power can defer equipment revenue.\n  - FX can swing quarterly results, despite net-neutral full-year assumption.\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver these forecasts as a spreadsheet with the annual and quarterly time series per driver and side-by-side comparison to historical actuals."

Earlier years are not available in the provided filings; therefore “last 5 fiscal years” includes all available actuals and then forward forecasts.\n- Seasonality: Quarterly forecasts distribute annual targets using 2024 revenue seasonality (Q1–Q4 shares ≈ 20.8%, 23.5%, 25.5%, 30.2%), then overlay known 2025Q1–Q2 actuals.\n- Segment splits in 2024Q3–Q4: Power/Wind allocations for those quarters are estimated by applying FY2024 non‑Electrification mix to the non‑Electrification remainder. Quarterly Electrification uses disclosed quarterly data.\n- Orders/RPO math: Where quarterly orders were not disclosed (e.g., 2025Q1), orders are inferred as Revenue + change in RPO (ignoring cancellations/FX revaluations). RPO forecasts use the standard approximation RPO(t) ≈ RPO(t‑1) + Orders − Revenue.\n- Equipment vs Services quarterly history (2024Q3–Q4): Estimated by applying FY2024 services share to quarterly totals. For 2025Q1–Q2, company equipment/services are actual; 2025Q3–2026Q2 are forecast to tie to annual totals.\n- Wind volumes: Quarterly GW were not disclosed in context; quarterly driver uses Wind equipment revenue as the operational proxy. Annual GW and implied $/GW are shown (2023–2029), with 2025–2029 based on segment/equipment projections and modest GW growth assumptions.\n- Geography: Only the FY2024 geographic breakout was provided; quarterly and forward geography assume the FY2024 mix (U.S. ≈42%; Europe ≈23.8%; Asia ≈13.4%; MEA ≈12.0%; Americas ex‑U.S. ≈8.7%).\n- Currency: All figures are USD. Rounding may cause small summation differences. Forecasts are management‑context‑consistent but not company guidance.\n- Risk sensitivities (execution and macro): Offshore wind execution, onshore policy/permitting, tariffs/input costs, and lead‑time normalization could shift timing and mix. Backlog conversion assumes stable cancellation rates and contract performance.",
    "two": "Synthesis note (context-to-forecast): Across GE Vernova’s revenue engine, three themes persist: (1) services are the ballast and continue to grow mid-single digits on a very large installed base, (2) Electrification is in a secular up‑cycle (lead-times, HV equipment scarcity, and rising RPO), and (3) Power grows steadily, led by services and disciplined equipment pricing, while (4) Wind transitions from 2024’s drag to a controlled, policy‑sensitive recovery as Offshore backlog burns down and Onshore repower remains healthy. 2025 growth outpaces served TAM as repriced backlog converts; beyond 2026, growth decelerates toward steady mid-single digits as industry capacity additions and normalization of price power gradually set in.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts and history\nAll figures in USD.

Earlier carve-out data are not available in the filing dataset used here, so annual “history” is limited to 2023–2024; quarterly history uses the last four reported quarters (2024 Q3–2025 Q2).\n- Backlog/RPO linkage: FY forecasts anchor on segment RPO and H1 2025 growth. Electrification grows fastest (backlog expansion and price discipline), Power grows mid-single digits led by services, Wind is flat-to-modestly up as Offshore burns down and Onshore repower persists.\n- Seasonality: Q4 is typically strongest (project deliveries and outage cadence). Quarterly forecasts respect this pattern; intra-year phasing may vary with project timing.\n- Eliminations: Segment totals exceed consolidated revenue due to intersegment eliminations. Equipment/services forecasts are set to reconcile to implied consolidated totals; segment-quarter forecasts are shown independently and may not sum precisely to mixed (equipment/services) forecasts each quarter.\n- FX/tariffs/execution: FX can create quarter-to-quarter noise; 2025 has a net tariff headwind at the corporate level and Offshore execution remains a watch item. Assumed impacts are embedded in conservative growth deceleration after 2026.\n- Book-to-bill: Orders forecasts assume book-to-bill modestly above 1x through the horizon (higher near-term, normalizing later), consistent with backlog coverage and market capacity constraints gradually easing.\n- Currency: All figures in US dollars."

    "one": "Synthesis note (optional)\n- Theme: Mix quality is improving. Growth is anchored by Electrification (capacity-constrained grid markets with strong backlog) and Power (services annuity plus disciplined equipment pricing), while Wind stabilizes around Onshore/services as Offshore legacy projects wind down through 2026. Orders and the >$119B RPO underpin conversion in 2025–2026.\n- Macro context: Policy-driven grid investment, firming needs from load growth (AI/data centers), and disciplined underwriting support pricing and backlog conversion. Rates and interconnection remain a headwind to new Onshore units; Offshore remains selective until economics reset.\n- Forecast posture: We assume 2025–2026 delivery cadence follows historical seasonality (Q4 heaviest) and that equipment backlog margin accretion (~+5 pts YoY into YE’24) supports continued price-positive organic growth with modest FX.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts and history\nAll figures in USD; “n/a” where disclosure is not available.

No new drivers introduced.\n- Data availability: GE Vernova standalone disclosures provide robust FY 2023–FY 2024 and 2025 YTD detail; earlier 5-year histories by driver are not available on a comparable carve-out basis. Quarterly segment splits for 2024Q3–Q4 are incomplete in the provided context; where unavailable, we show n/a and do not fabricate.\n- Methodology: Quarterly forecasts align to annual totals and historical seasonality (Q4 heaviest). Segment growth rates are anchored to: Electrification backlog expansion; Power services resilience and selective equipment; Wind stabilization via Onshore/services with constrained Offshore intake until post-2026. Eliminations modeled at ~-500M annually (~-125M/quarter) to bridge segment totals to consolidated revenue.\n- Dependence on backlog and execution: Conversion timing, especially for Electrification (HVDC, transformers) and Power outages, is a key swing factor. Offshore legacy projects remain a risk until fully executed (target largely complete by 2026).\n- Macro sensitivities: Onshore new-unit demand remains sensitive to rates and interconnection; gas market dynamics and outage timing affect Power; permitting/policy can shift quarter phasing.\n- Currency: FX historically small at the consolidated level (FY2024 ≈ -6M); forecasts assume immaterial FX vs. price/mix.\n- Verification: All historical numbers cited are from GE Vernova filings/press releases summarized in the provided context; forecasts are analytical and explicitly tied to those baselines and disclosed backlog/orders trends.",

Historical figures are taken directly from the context; where quarterly or sub-series are not disclosed, I label them accordingly. Forecasts are my estimates, with assumptions stated at the end.\n\n1) Synthesis note (optional)\n- Cross-driver themes: Backlog-rich growth. Orders have exceeded revenue for two straight years (2023–2024), pushing RPO higher and providing multi-quarter visibility. This supports continued growth in both equipment and services.\n- Catalysts:\n  - Power: Gas additions are running strong (>60 GW in 2025 per management), with services breadth and outage/upgrades density lifting recurring services.\n  - Electrification: A “seller’s market” with long lead-times (transformers/HVDC) and accelerating North America demand (data centers, modernization). This tilts segment mix toward Electrification.\n  - Wind: Selective underwriting stabilizes onshore; services/repower uplift margins; offshore remains the primary execution swing factor.\n- Macro context alignment: TAM signals point to steady gas, rising grid investment, and gradually improving wind outside China.

see annual section for FY mix.\n\n4) Assumptions and caveats\n- Scope and source limits\n  - Historical coverage: Standalone consolidated quarterly and annual data are provided in context primarily for 2023–2025H1. Earlier years (FY-5 to FY-2) are not disclosed in this dataset; I therefore present “as available” history.\n  - Where quarterly segment splits (e.g., 2024Q3–Q4 for Power/Electrification) or quarterly orders/RPO were not disclosed, I mark them “Not disclosed” and do not fabricate history.\n- Forecast framework\n  - Equipment revenue: Strong 2025 uplift reflects 2025H1 momentum, larger gas turbine volumes (>60 GW global adds per mgmt) and healthier repower flow; post-2025, I moderate to mid-single-digit growth consistent with disciplined gas capacity, steady wind, and grid execution cadence.\n  - Services revenue: Modeled at mid-single-digit growth (≈5–6%) on installed-base monetization (Power dominant; Wind/Electrification attachment increasing as projects mature).\n  - Orders and RPO: Orders assumed to exceed revenue each year (orders/revenue ~1.2–1.25x near term) to sustain RPO growth in a seller’s market for grid and with solid Power services. Annual order growth slows to mid-single-digit after 2025 off a higher base.\n  - Segment mix: Electrification grows the fastest on grid capex momentum; Power grows steadily on services and healthy turbine intake; Wind grows modestly with selective onshore, services and repower; offshore remains the key risk but backlog execution improves.\n  - Geography/FX: U.S. share drifts higher given North America grid and data-center demand; I assume FX nets to ~0 over the FY forecast horizon (directional, not a hedging assertion).\n- Reconciliation notes\n  - Segment totals vs consolidated: Public segment totals may not perfectly reconcile to consolidated revenue each quarter due to eliminations/timing; immaterial gaps can appear.\n  - Quarterly seasonality: Q4 typically stronger (project timing); I reflect this in quarterly patterns for equipment and services. Actual cadence will vary with project milestones, especially in Wind and Electrification.\n- Risk sensitivities\n  - Wind offshore execution and quality remediation can shift quarterly revenue recognition; policy/permits can swing onshore volumes.\n  - Grid equipment lead-times and supply constraints support pricing but can defer revenue if component bottlenecks persist.\n  - FX is volatile quarter-to-quarter; while modest at FY scale in 2024, swings (e.g., 2025Q1) can impact reported growth.\n\nIf you want, I can also deliver these forecasts as a spreadsheet with driver tabs and editable growth-rate assumptions so you can run scenarios (e.g., higher Electrification growth, lower Wind) and see the flow-through to each driver by quarter and year."

    "one": "Synthesis note (cross-driver themes)\n- Near-term trajectory is led by Electrification backlog conversion and sustained Power services strength; Wind remains a managed turnaround (offshore backlog burn, selective onshore).\n- Orders and RPO are expanding faster than revenue, lifting visibility. Pricing remains positive across segments; FX is a secondary, quarter-to-quarter noise factor.\n- Macro tailwinds: grid buildout (HV equipment/HVDC), firming capacity for data center and reliability (gas turbines/services), disciplined wind underwriting. These shape a mid–high single-digit consolidated revenue slope with mix rotating to Electrification and Services.\n\nDriver 1: Segment mix and growth (Power, Wind, Electrification)\n- Sources (history): 2023—sum of quarterly filings; 2024—10-K and 8-K; 2025 Q1–Q3—company 10-Qs/press releases; Q4’24 and Q3’25 segment splits—company presentations/press releases (Jan 22, 2025; Oct 22, 2025).\n\nAnnual (USD millions)\n- History\n  - 2023 (FY-2): Total 33,239; Power 17,293; Wind 9,815; Electrification 6,118\n  - 2024 (FY-1): Total 34,935; Power 18,127; Wind 9,701; Electrification 7,550\n- Forecast\n  - 2025 (FY0): Total 36,700; Power 18,460; Wind 9,128; Electrification 9,113\n    - Basis: Q1 $8,032; Q2 $9,111; Q3 ~$10,000; Q4 forecast ~$9,557; segment mix scaled to Q3 run-rate and H1 mix\n  - 2026 (FY1): Total 38,258; Power 19,198; Wind 8,671; Electrification 10,389\n  - 2027 (FY2): Total 40,446; Power 19,966; Wind 8,845; Electrification 11,635\n  - 2028 (FY3): Total 42,790; Power 20,764; Wind 9,110; Electrification 12,915\n  - 2029 (FY4): Total 45,185; Power 21,595; Wind 9,383; Electrification 14,207\n  - Segment growth assumptions FY1–FY4: Power ~+4% CAGR; Electrification decelerating from +14% to ~+10% CAGR; Wind −5% in 2026 as offshore backlog completes, then +2–3% thereafter (repower/services).\n\nQuarterly (USD millions)\n- History (Q-4 to Q-1)\n  - Q4’24: Total ~10,600; Power ~4,800; Wind ~3,100; Electrification ~2,700\n  - Q1’25: Total 8,032; Power ~4,400; Wind ~1,800; Electrification ~1,900\n  - Q2’25: Total 9,111; Power ~4,800; Wind ~2,200; Electrification ~2,200\n  - Q3’25: Total ~10,000; Power ~4,800; Wind ~2,600; Electrification ~2,600\n- Forecast (Q0 to Q3)\n  - Q4’25 (Q0): Total ~9,557; Power ~4,587; Wind ~2,485; Electrification ~2,485\n    - Basis: FY25 target of ~$36.7B (top-end skew), Q3 mix applied; wind lighter than 4Q24 given selective intake\n  - Q1’26 (Q1): Total ~8,366; Power ~4,541; Wind ~1,950; Electrification ~1,875\n  - Q2’26 (Q2): Total ~9,488; Power ~5,153; Wind ~2,188; Electrification ~2,148\n  - Q3’26 (Q3): Total ~10,458; Power ~5,414; Wind ~2,253; Electrification ~2,791\n    - Basis: Distributing FY26 by 2025 seasonality, with segment growth rates above.\n\nDriver 2: Services vs Equipment mix\n- Sources (history): 2023/2024 equipment and services (8-K, income statement); 2025H1 (10-Q); Q3’25 services/equipment mix per press release (Oct 22, 2025).\n\nAnnual (USD millions)\n- History\n  - 2023: Equipment 18,258; Services 14,981; Total 33,239\n  - 2024: Equipment 18,952; Services 15,983; Total 34,935\n- Forecast\n  - 2025: Equipment ~20,544; Services ~16,156; Total 36,700\n    - Basis: H1’25 services $8,052; Q3’25 services ~$4,089; Q4’25 services assumed ~42% of total (Q3 mix)\n  - 2026: Equipment ~20,809; Services ~17,449; Total 38,258\n  - 2027: Equipment ~21,426; Services ~19,020; Total 40,446\n  - 2028: Equipment ~22,160; Services ~20,631; Total 42,790\n  - 2029: Equipment ~22,904; Services ~22,281; Total 45,185\n  - Assumptions: Services +8–9% p.a.

2024 10-K/8-K; 2025 Q1–Q3 10-Qs and press releases (Apr 23, Jul 23, Oct 22, 2025). Where quarterly segment splits or equipment/services splits were not itemized, we used company-reported mix and H1 totals to derive consistent estimates; rounding may cause small differences.\n- FY2025 revenue anchored to company’s updated outlook: trending to the high end of $36–$37B; we model ~$36.7B. Quarterly Q4’25 distribution reflects typical seasonality, wind selectivity, and Electrification strength.\n- Segment FY2026–FY2029 growth: Power ~+4% CAGR (services-led; steady gas equipment), Electrification decelerating from mid-teens to ~+10% by 2029 (grid bottlenecks easing but demand strong), Wind −5% in 2026 (offshore backlog burn) and low single-digit growth thereafter (onshore repower/services). These are consistent with management commentary, backlog momentum, and TAM framing (Electrification fastest).\n- Orders/RPO: 2025 orders and RPO use Q1–Q3 actuals and typical Q4 strength to set FY assumptions; RPO cover computed as RPO/Revenue. RPO quarterly figures are reported at period-end; Q3’25 RPO (~$141.9B) is derived from company-stated sequential increase.\n- FX and organic: FX is small at the full-year level but can be material intra-year; we use disclosed Q1–Q3’25 FX effects and assume a modest Q4 headwind to estimate FY. Organic growth percentages reflect company disclosures (quarterly) and are consistent with forecast totals.\n- Units: 2025 wind/gas units were not fully disclosed in the reviewed public set. We provide directional annual and quarterly ranges anchored to 2023–2024 actuals, 2025 run-rate, and segment commentary (e.g., 20 HDGT shipped in Q3’25). Revenue recognition can diverge from unit orders due to project timing/mix.\n- Only drivers in scope: We restrict to the five core drivers listed (segment mix; services vs equipment; orders/backlog; pricing/FX/organic; unit volume/execution). No additional drivers introduced.\n- Currency: All figures in USD.",
    "two": "Synthesis (brief)\n- The services engine (especially in Power) remains the most durable, backlog-backed driver, growing mid‑single digits with positive pricing and expanding upgrade scope. Equipment growth is accelerating into 2026–2027 as gas OEM slots remain scarce; grid/electrification remains a structural tailwind (orders > revenue; lead times long). Wind is improving near term on mix and repower, but 2026 onshore downshift is expected before resuming modest growth.\n- Orders and RPO are the central glue: 2025 orders ~50B and RPO rising ≥$13B in 2025 underpin conversion. FX remains a small annual swing factor but can be volatile QoQ.\n\nRevenue driver forecasts\nAll figures in USD millions unless noted.

Where quarterly details were incomplete in filings, I used directly disclosed items (e.g., 3Q24 services and total revenue) and reconciled the remainder from audited FY totals; no unaudited estimates were introduced.\n- Alignment to filed data:\n  - 2024, 2025Q1–Q2 actuals and segment totals align with company filings; 3Q24 company services (~$3.6B) and revenue (~$8.9B) come from the company’s quarterly release; 2024Q4 services derived as FY services minus Q1–Q3.\n  - RPO figures reflect reported 2024Q4, 2025Q1, and 2025Q2; 2025 orders ~50B and ≥$13B RPO increase are management disclosures.\n- Forecast methodology:\n  - Services: mid‑single‑digit growth sustained by Power LTSAs and upgrades; Electrification services add. Quarterly cadence tracks seasonal outage patterns.\n  - Power revenue: grow high‑single digits through 2026–2027 (equipment backlog conversion; slot scarcity) then moderate. Quarterly growth guided by YoY prints and normal seasonality.\n  - Wind revenue: 2025 modest growth on mix/repower; 2026 decline of ~12% consistent with management’s onshore outlook; thereafter gradual recovery.\n  - Orders/RPO: orders step to ~50B in 2025; RPO accumulates with Electrification lead times and Power slot reservations; out‑years assume sustained book‑to‑bill >1x in Electrification and robust Power intake.\n  - Equipment vs services: equipment grows faster during equipment conversion years (2025–2027); services share trends up slightly over time.\n  - FX: 2025 set to a small net headwind given 1H prints; neutral thereafter (modeling convention).\n- Dependencies and sensitivities:\n  - Electrification execution pace, transformer/HVDC lead times, and hyperscaler demand could shift revenue timing materially (both up and right).\n  - Gas turbine deliveries depend on EPC capacity, permitting, and slot reservation conversions—slippages would push equipment revenue to the right but keep services resilient.\n  - Wind remains sensitive to U.S. permitting/tariffs, offshore execution, and any additional remediation; 2026 onshore step-down reflects management commentary.\n  - FX and mix by geography can introduce quarterly noise; annual impact historically small.\n- Currency: All amounts in US dollars; “n/a” denotes not disclosed/available in filings for that period.\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver the above in a spreadsheet with driver-by-driver time series and a side-by-side bridge from historicals to forecasts."

    "one": "Synthesis note\n- Cross-driver themes: Services are the structural growth engine (Power and, increasingly, Electrification), while equipment cycles drive near-term volatility (Wind volumes, Gas new-unit timing). Orders remain >1x revenue, expanding RPO and providing multi‑year visibility. Mix continues to shift toward Electrification as grid investment accelerates.\n- Catalysts: Grid programs (HVDC, transformers) and tight capacity support Electrification growth and pricing; Power benefits from rising LTSA/transactional services and tighter heavy‑duty turbine slots; Wind recovery hinges on steady onshore repowers and disciplined offshore execution.\n- Macro linkage: Grid TAM expansion (IEA) and U.S. load growth (data centers) support Electrification and Gas Power; Wind remains selective with U.S.-led repowers.

Organic total +0.05 (~+5%)\n    - 2026Q3 (Q3): FX 0M; Organic total +0.05 (~+5%)\n\nHow the forecasts were built and cross-checks\n- FY2025 baseline: H1’25 actuals (equipment 9,091M; services 8,052M; total 17,143M), 2024Q3–2025Q2 cadence (equipment/services ramp), 2024–2025 orders trajectory (2024FY 44,107M; 2025Q1–Q2 22,516M), and RPO lift from 119,023M (2024Q4) to 123,438M (2025Q1) inform conversion and seasonality. Result: FY2025 total implied ~37.3B (equipment 20.05B; services 17.25B).\n- FY2026–FY2029 path: Electrification growth (double-digit), Power steady-to-growing (services annuity and disciplined equipment), Wind conservative near-term (onshore softness in 2026, gradual recovery thereafter). Orders grow mid-single to high-single digits; RPO compounds accordingly.\n- Quarterly Q0–Q3: Seasonality patterned on 2024/2025 cadence (Q4 strongest), with orders/RPO supporting conversion in subsequent quarters. FX assumed small and mean-reverting.\n\nAssumptions and caveats\n- Scope and data availability\n  - Historical coverage: GEV has two complete fiscal years of standalone financials (2023–2024). I include those plus 2025Q1–Q2 actuals and 2024Q1–Q4 actuals where available, then forecast onward. Earlier years (pre-2023) are not available on a consistent standalone basis.\n  - Quarterly detail: For each driver, I included the last four actual quarters where disclosed (2024Q3–2025Q2), then four forecast quarters (2025Q4–2026Q3). Where RPO was not disclosed for a specific quarter, I provide the closest available end-of-period.\n- Methodology\n  - Equipment and services forecasts are anchored in H1’25 actuals, backlog/RPO levels, segment momentum, and known wind-cycle softness into 2026; quarterly seasonality follows 2024–2025 patterns.\n  - Segment forecasts reflect: Electrification double-digit growth off a ~7.6B FY2024 base; Power steady growth with services; Wind flat-to-down in 2025 and -10–15% in 2026 (onshore softness) with a gradual recovery thereafter.\n  - FX: 2024 full-year FX impact was de minimis; quarterly swings can be large. I assume small, netting to ~0 beyond 2025.\n- Dependencies and sensitivities\n  - Wind: Project timing, auction outcomes, tariffs, and offshore/onshore mix can materially move quarterly units and revenue.\n  - Electrification: Conversion timing for HVDC and transformers can shift revenue between quarters; supply-chain and factory ramp pacing are key.\n  - Power: Outage schedules/utilization drive services cadence; large equipment slots remain capacity constrained but price/mix supportive.\n  - Orders-to-revenue conversion depends on permitting, execution milestones, and customer readiness; RPO growth does not always translate linearly quarter-to-quarter.\n- Use of sources\n  - All historical figures used above come from company filings and reported KPIs in the provided context (income statement, segment disaggregation, KPI modules for orders/RPO/FX and unit shipments). Forecasts are my calculations based on those data and the market/TAM framing included in context.\n\nIf you want these forecasts delivered in an exportable model with formulas (by driver, quarter, and year), I can provide a spreadsheet."

Quarterly history uses the last four reported quarters available (2024Q3–2025Q2). FY0 is 2025.\n\nSynthesis note (optional)\n- Core setup: Services are the primary stabilizer and grower; equipment accelerates with backlog conversion but is more volatile. Mix is improving as Electrification scales; Wind remains the most timing- and policy-sensitive. Book-to-bill >1x and rising RPO support sustained revenue conversion; FX translation is a secondary swing factor.\n- Catalysts: Electrification backlog expansion, U.S. hyperscaler/data-center demand, gas upcycle (Power services) drive growth. Management’s call for a 2026 onshore wind revenue reset (-10% to -15%) is embedded in the 2026 Wind forecast and softens equipment growth near term.\n- Macro lens: Structural grid capex and gas capacity additions underpin multi‑year growth; FX remains variable but modest vs operational drivers.\n\nDriver 1: Equipment revenue (Sales of equipment)\n- Annual (history, then forecast)\n  - 2023: 18,258\n  - 2024: 18,952\n  - 2025 (FY0E): 21,729\n  - 2026 (FY1E): 21,511\n  - 2027 (FY2E): 22,157\n  - 2028 (FY3E): 23,043\n  - 2029 (FY4E): 23,965\n- Quarterly (history Q-4 to Q-1, then Q0–Q3)\n  - 2024Q3: 5,290\n  - 2024Q4: 5,852\n  - 2025Q1: 4,197\n  - 2025Q2: 4,894\n  - 2025Q3 (Q0E): 6,084\n  - 2025Q4 (Q1E): 6,554\n  - 2026Q1 (Q2E): 4,407\n  - 2026Q2 (Q3E): 5,139\n\nDriver 2: Services revenue (Sales of services)\n- Annual (history, then forecast)\n  - 2023: 14,981\n  - 2024: 15,983\n  - 2025 (FY0E): 16,929\n  - 2026 (FY1E): 18,114\n  - 2027 (FY2E): 19,201\n  - 2028 (FY3E): 20,161\n  - 2029 (FY4E): 21,169\n- Quarterly (history Q-4 to Q-1, then Q0–Q3)\n  - 2024Q3: 3,623\n  - 2024Q4: 4,707\n  - 2025Q1: 3,835\n  - 2025Q2: 4,217\n  - 2025Q3 (Q0E): 3,840\n  - 2025Q4 (Q1E): 5,036\n  - 2026Q1 (Q2E): 4,065\n  - 2026Q2 (Q3E): 4,470\n\nDriver 3: Segment mix (segment revenues: Power, Wind, Electrification)\n- Annual (history, then forecast)\n  - Power\n    - 2023: 17,293\n    - 2024: 18,127\n    - 2025 (FY0E): 19,312\n    - 2026 (FY1E): 20,278\n    - 2027 (FY2E): 21,089\n    - 2028 (FY3E): 21,933\n    - 2029 (FY4E): 22,700\n  - Wind\n    - 2023: 9,815\n    - 2024: 9,701\n    - 2025 (FY0E): 10,411\n    - 2026 (FY1E): 9,109  [management 2026 reset embedded]\n    - 2027 (FY2E): 9,383\n    - 2028 (FY3E): 9,758\n    - 2029 (FY4E): 10,148\n  - Electrification\n    - 2023: 6,118\n    - 2024: 7,550\n    - 2025 (FY0E): 9,148\n    - 2026 (FY1E): 10,520\n    - 2027 (FY2E): 11,782\n    - 2028 (FY3E): 12,960\n    - 2029 (FY4E): 14,127\n- Quarterly (history Q-4 to Q-1, then Q0–Q3)\n  - 2024Q3: Power 4,151; Wind 2,880; Electrification 1,876\n  - 2024Q4: Power 5,556; Wind 3,135; Electrification 2,347\n  - 2025Q1: Power 4,423; Wind 1,850; Electrification 1,879\n  - 2025Q2: Power 4,758; Wind 2,245; Electrification 2,201\n  - 2025Q3 (Q0E): Power 4,649; Wind 3,024; Electrification 2,251\n  - 2025Q4 (Q1E): Power 5,483; Wind 3,292; Electrification 2,816\n  - 2026Q1 (Q2E): Power 4,692; Wind 1,619; Electrification 2,161\n  - 2026Q2 (Q3E): Power 5,113; Wind 1,964; Electrification 2,531\nNote: Segment totals may not perfectly reconcile to consolidated revenue due to “Other and eliminations” in filings.\n\nDriver 4: Orders and backlog conversion (Total orders; Remaining Performance Obligations, RPO)\n- Annual orders (history, then forecast)\n  - 2023: 41,637\n  - 2024: 44,107\n  - 2025 (FY0E): 50,000\n  - 2026 (FY1E): 51,000\n  - 2027 (FY2E): 53,000\n  - 2028 (FY3E): 55,000\n  - 2029 (FY4E): 57,000\n- Annual RPO (end of year; history, then forecast)\n  - 2024: 119,023\n  - 2025 (FY0E): 132,000\n  - 2026 (FY1E): 136,000\n  - 2027 (FY2E): 140,000\n  - 2028 (FY3E): 145,000\n  - 2029 (FY4E): 150,000\n- Quarterly orders (history Q-4 to Q-1, then Q0–Q3)\n  - 2024Q3: 9,397\n  - 2024Q4: 13,207\n  - 2025Q1: 10,152\n  - 2025Q2: 12,364\n  - 2025Q3 (Q0E): 12,500\n  - 2025Q4 (Q1E): 15,000\n  - 2026Q1 (Q2E): 12,500\n  - 2026Q2 (Q3E): 13,000\n- RPO (quarterly snapshots, select available)\n  - 2024Q4: 119,023\n  - 2025Q1: 123,438\n  - 2025Q2: Electrification backlog 27.5B; Power ~79.1B; Wind ~22.5B (company KPIs).

Where the rule calls for five years of history, I present all years available.\n  - Quarterly geography is not disclosed; I therefore provide annual geography only.\n  - FX impact is taken from the “foreign currency effect” in the company’s organic revenue reconciliation; full-year 2023 is the sum of quarterly prints.\n- Forecast mechanics:\n  - 2025 quarterly forecasts extend 1H25 YoY patterns and seasonal cadence, with equipment +~15% YoY in 2H25 and services +~6–7% YoY, consistent with backlog conversion and late-year services lift.\n  - Wind 2026: embeds management commentary of a -10% to -15% revenue reset; I use -12.5% for 2026, with modest growth thereafter.\n  - Electrification accelerates with a strong backlog and hyperscaler-led demand; Power grows mid-single digits, led by services.\n  - Orders kept >1x book-to-bill; RPO increases annually (approx. +$13B in 2025, tapering thereafter).\n  - FX assumed neutral beyond 2025 due to limited predictability; historical magnitudes are small versus operational drivers.\n- Reconciliation: Segment totals may not exactly match consolidated revenue each period due to “Other and eliminations” line items; this is consistent with the company’s reported segment tables.\n- Currency: All figures in USD; minor rounding may create small summation differences.\n- Risk factors affecting the forecast trajectory: U.S. onshore wind policy/tariff volatility; project timing and supply-chain execution in equipment-heavy quarters; FX shifts; potential pricing normalization if grid supply increases faster than demand.\n\nIf you want these forecasts delivered in a spreadsheet with formulas and sensitivity toggles (e.g., alternative Wind 2026 scenarios or Electrification growth ranges), I can generate one.",
    "two": "Below is a forward-looking, driver-by-driver revenue framework for GE Vernova (ticker: GEV) built from the most recent disclosed financials and the context provided. I constrain all drivers to those in context and keep the metrics consistent with the company’s disclosures. Currency: US Dollars.\n\nSynthesis note (short)\n- Backlog-to-revenue conversion and services growth are the spine of the outlook. Orders are on pace to ~$50B in 2025, with RPO rising, giving multi-quarter visibility. Power and Electrification lead, while Wind normalizes after 2024 execution shocks with selective underwriting. Tariffs/affordability are headwinds to unit growth but do not impair services momentum.\n- Quarterly cadence: seasonality favors Q4; services are steady across quarters; equipment tilts to 2H on deliveries. In 2026, onshore wind softness (−10–15% discussed by management) is reflected in equipment and Wind totals before a modest rebound thereafter.\n\nDriver 1) Services expansion and installed base utilization\nMetric used: Sales of services (income statement)\n\nAnnual (history and forecast)\n- 2023: 14,981m (Income statement | Sales of services, sum of 2023Q1–Q4: 3,333; 3,732; 3,383; 4,533)\n- 2024: 15,983m (Income statement | Sales of services_2024FY)\n- 2025 (FY0) forecast: 16,798m (Derived: apply ~5% YoY run-rate visible in 2025Q1–Q2)\n- 2026 (FY1) forecast: 17,638m (Derived: +5%)\n- 2027 (FY2) forecast: 18,520m (Derived: +5%)\n- 2028 (FY3) forecast: 19,446m (Derived: +5%)\n- 2029 (FY4) forecast: 20,418m (Derived: +5%)\n\nQuarterly (last 4 actual, then Q0–Q3 forecast)\n- History: 2024Q3 3,623m; 2024Q4 4,707m; 2025Q1 3,835m; 2025Q2 4,217m (Income statement | Sales of services)\n- Forecast:\n  - 2025Q3 (Q0): 3,804m (Derived: +5% vs 2024Q3)\n  - 2025Q4 (Q1): 4,942m (Derived: +5% vs 2024Q4)\n  - 2026Q1 (Q2): 4,027m (Derived: +5% vs 2025Q1)\n  - 2026Q2 (Q3): 4,428m (Derived: +5% vs 2025Q2)\n\nDriver 2) Equipment volume and mix (gas turbines and wind units)\nMetric used: Sales of equipment (income statement)\n\nAnnual (history and forecast)\n- 2023: 18,258m (Income statement | Sales of equipment, sum of 2023Q1–Q4: 3,489; 4,388; 4,869; 5,512)\n- 2024: 18,952m (Income statement | Sales of equipment_2024FY)\n- 2025 (FY0) forecast: 20,202m (Derived: to reconcile to total revenue ~37,000m guide)\n- 2026 (FY1) forecast: 19,798m (Derived: −2% on wind softness)\n- 2027 (FY2) forecast: 20,392m (Derived: +3%)\n- 2028 (FY3) forecast: 21,208m (Derived: +4%)\n- 2029 (FY4) forecast: 22,056m (Derived: +4%)\n\nQuarterly (last 4 actual, then Q0–Q3 forecast)\n- History: 2024Q3 5,290m; 2024Q4 5,852m; 2025Q1 4,197m; 2025Q2 4,894m (Income statement | Sales of equipment)\n- Forecast:\n  - 2025Q3 (Q0): 5,290m (Derived: flat YoY)\n  - 2025Q4 (Q1): 5,821m (Derived: slight calibration to hit FY total)\n  - 2026Q1 (Q2): 4,113m (Derived: −2% vs 2025Q1)\n  - 2026Q2 (Q3): 4,796m (Derived: −2% vs 2025Q2)\n\nDriver 3) Segment mix shift (Power/Electrification vs. Wind)\nMetric used: Segment revenues (Power, Electrification, Wind)\n\nAnnual (history and forecast)\n- 2023:\n  - Power: 17,293m; Electrification: 6,118m; Wind: 9,815m (Segment totals, sums of 2023Q1–Q4)\n- 2024:\n  - Power: 18,127m; Electrification: 7,550m; Wind: 9,701m (10-K | Segment totals_2024FY)\n- 2025 (FY0) forecast:\n  - Power: 18,742m; Electrification: 8,239m; Wind: 10,019m (Derived: H1 actuals plus H2 allocated to match 37,000m total)\n- 2026 (FY1) forecast:\n  - Power: 19,304m (+3%); Electrification: 8,898m (+8%); Wind: 8,817m (−12%) (Derived)\n- 2027 (FY2) forecast:\n  - Power: 19,883m (+3%); Electrification: 9,610m (+8%); Wind: 9,082m (+3%) (Derived)\n- 2028 (FY3) forecast:\n  - Power: 20,281m (+2%); Electrification: 10,283m (+7%); Wind: 9,536m (+5%) (Derived)\n- 2029 (FY4) forecast:\n  - Power: 20,687m (+2%); Electrification: 11,003m (+7%); Wind: 10,013m (+5%) (Derived)\n\nQuarterly (last 4 actual, then Q0–Q3 forecast)\n- History (segment revenue totals):\n  - 2024Q3: Power 4,151m; Electrification 1,876m; Wind 2,880m\n  - 2024Q4: Power 5,556m; Electrification 2,347m; Wind 3,135m\n  - 2025Q1: Power 4,423m; Electrification 1,879m; Wind 1,850m\n  - 2025Q2: Power 4,758m; Electrification 2,201m; Wind 2,245m\n- Forecast:\n  - 2025Q3 (Q0): Power 4,089m; Electrification 1,848m; Wind 2,836m (Derived: H2 allocation vs 2024Q3/Q4 mix)\n  - 2025Q4 (Q1): Power 5,472m; Electrification 2,311m; Wind 3,088m\n  - 2026Q1 (Q2): Power 4,556m; Electrification 2,029m; Wind 1,628m (Derived: segment growth assumptions applied to 2025Q1 base)\n  - 2026Q2 (Q3): Power 4,901m; Electrification 2,377m; Wind 1,976m\n\nDriver 4) Pricing and underwriting discipline\nProxy metric: Organic segment EBITDA margin by segment (percent).

I provided clearly labeled Derived quarterly geography using annual share proxies.\n- Orders/backlog:\n  - 2025 orders of ~50,000m are a forecast consistent with 1H25 actuals (10,152m; 12,364m) and management’s “orders ~50B vs revenue ~37B” cadence. RPO point estimates beyond reported dates are directional, based on RPO ≈ prior RPO + orders − revenue and assume minimal cancellations/FX adjustments.\n- Pricing proxy:\n  - “Pricing and underwriting discipline” is proxied with organic segment EBITDA margins because price/mix is not reported as a discrete revenue line. These margins reflect the quality of revenue and pricing discipline noted by management.\n- 2026 Wind caution:\n  - The 2026 Wind revenue reduction (−12%) reflects management commentary that onshore revenue could be down 10–15% in 2026; offshore backlog executes under tighter underwriting. Subsequent years assume stabilization and modest growth as services/repowers contribute.\n- Seasonality:\n  - Quarterly forecasts respect historical seasonality (Q4 heavier) and observed 2025H1 run-rates. Any significant delivery phasing changes (e.g., HVDC or offshore milestones) would shift quarterly equipment patterns.\n- Tariffs/FX:\n  - Tariff headwinds ($300–$400m in 2025 cited) and FX can affect reported quarterly revenue; the forecasts assume no material change in tariff regimes or FX beyond current disclosures.\n\nIf you want these forecasts delivered in a spreadsheet with each driver on its own tab (annual and quarterly), I can generate that next."

All historical values are taken from filings/press releases cited above; where quarter detail was not disclosed in the excerpts, values are labeled n/a or calculated transparently from filed totals (Calc).\n  - USD throughout; no inflation adjustments applied.\n- Forecast method\n  - Linked to observed run‑rates (H1’25 actuals), disclosed guidance commentaries, backlog/RPO trends, and capacity ramp disclosures. Equipment/services and segment forecasts are aligned to the same narrative and seasonality (Q4 skew).\n  - Gas turbine unit forecasts reflect capacity ramp timing (70–80 HDGTs/yr from 2H26) and H1’25 unit trajectory; wind units assume onshore stability in 2025, improving in 2026+ with selective growth; offshore is a run‑off with no new awards assumed.\n  - Orders and RPO forecasts assume continued tight slots in gas and sustained grid demand; book‑to‑bill ~1.1–1.2x over the near term normalizing later in the horizon.\n  - FX/inorganic assumed neutral in forward periods due to small 2024 impacts; actuals could vary with currency regimes and M&A.\n- Limitations\n  - Five‑year annual history not fully available in excerpts; presented “as available.” Quarterly services/equipment for 2024Q4 not disclosed in the excerpts; quarterly orders for 2024Q3–Q4 not available—RPO provided as the primary quarterly backlog indicator.\n  - Wind unit quarterly detail uses 10‑Q Q3’24 disclosures and reconciles to 2024FY; definition includes turbine and repower units as reported in filings.\n- Sensitivities and catalysts\n  - Upside: Faster Electrification conversion from record RPO; gas equipment deliveries accelerate with EPC/permitting throughput; services pricing/mix stays positive across segments.\n  - Downside: Wind offshore execution/tariff headwinds; permitting/transformer supply constraints delaying grid projects; macro FX swings; delay in SRA conversions.\n- Alignment\n  - Forecast continues the observed 2024–H1’25 trajectory: services growth outpacing equipment on an organic basis, Electrification and Power leading, with Wind stabilizing via services/repower and selective unit volume.",
    "two": "Synthesis (context → forecast)\n- Demand/backlog set-up: Orders continue to outpace revenue (2024 orders $44.1B vs revenue $34.9B; 2025e orders ≈$50B) with adjusted backlog rising (YE24 $119.0B; 2025Q1 $123.4B; YE25e ≥$132B). This supports continued revenue conversion in Power and Electrification while Wind remains selective and policy‑sensitive.\n- Mix/cycle: Services grew faster than equipment in 2024 (+6.7% vs +3.8%); 1H25 showed a product-led acceleration (+16–17% equipment YoY) alongside continued services growth (~+5%). Gas equipment pricing remains healthy amid slot scarcity; grid pricing remains constructive; onshore wind focuses on U.S. and repower, with offshore execution paced by backlog burn-down.\n- Macro tailwinds: U.S. load growth (data centers, re‑industrialization), HVDC/transformer constraints, and elevated HDGT additions underpin sustained Power/Electrification growth.

Earlier fiscal-year detail is not available on a comparable basis; therefore, we show all available history (2023–2024) as requested.\n- Quarterly data gaps: Company-level quarterly totals for some drivers (e.g., 2024Q3 total orders; 2024Q4 full segment split) were not explicitly disclosed in the text extracts. We reported what is disclosed (e.g., Q4 total orders ≈$13.2B; Q3 segment values where available) and otherwise refrained from inventing historical numbers.\n- Forecast anchors: FY2025 revenue is aligned to ~$37B company commentary and H1 actuals; orders ≈$50B and backlog increase ≥$13B for 2025 underpin conversion. Post‑2025 growth modeled mid‑single‑digit with services share gradually rising.\n- Units outlook: Gas turbines grow into constrained OEM capacity and stronger U.S./ME orders; wind units remain selective in 2025 (U.S. onshore and repower emphasis), improving in 2026–2029 as policy/queue frictions ease and offshore backlog burns down. Unit-to-revenue is not 1:1 due to timing and mix.\n- Pricing/FX: Pricing remains positive across segments; FX modeled as a second‑order noise factor. We did not forecast currency by currency; quarterly FX effects are placeholders for planning only.\n- Risk factors: Execution on large projects (HVDC, offshore wind), U.S. onshore policy/tariff and interconnection timing, OEM capacity changes in gas, and EU affordability constraints could alter slope and mix. Forecasts are not company guidance.\n\nIf you want the above in a spreadsheet with formulas and a sensitivity section (e.g., orders-to-revenue conversion or gas slot capacity scenarios), I can generate it."

TAM trajectory (management: ~$265B in 2024 to ≥$435B by 2030) informs medium-term growth envelopes.\n- Mix assumptions: Wind Onshore dominates Wind; Offshore remains execution-focused (limited new intake under legacy economics). U.S. mix inches higher on IRA pull-through (Onshore RPO ~75% U.S. per management framing).\n- Pricing/margins: Backlog margin uplift supports gradual margin expansion in Power/Electrification; Wind margins improve as legacy Offshore rolls off (breakeven targeted around 2027 in our base case).\n- FX: Quarterly volatility persists; annual impact assumed modest absent a structural USD regime shift.\n- Dependencies: RPO conversion cadence, permitting/policy timing (IRA, EU), supply-chain localization, and commodity/labor costs. Wind orders remain sensitive to U.S. timing and Offshore PPAs; Electrification growth depends on HV equipment capacity ramps.\n- Uncertainty: Quarterly granularity is inherently noisier; where historical quarterly values were not available, we provided forecasts with explicit segmentation and stated assumptions to maintain continuity with annual disclosures.",
    "two": "Below is a focused, tool-sourced forecast for GE Vernova’s (GEV) core revenue drivers, keeping definitions exactly as in context. All historical figures are from GEV filings; forecasts are my estimates stated with assumptions. Currency: US Dollars.\n\nSynthesis (brief)\n- Durable annuity and backlog power mix. Power services continues to compound mid-single digits on a deepening RPO base; Electrification is scaling rapidly on HV equipment and hyperscaler-led demand; Wind is being run for price/mix and services with selective equipment volumes and offshore backlog burn.\n- Orders and RPO underpin forward visibility. Orders and RPO rose through 1H25; Electrification backlog reached $27.5B in 2Q25, Power $79.1B, and total RPO was $128.7B at 2Q25, supporting multi-quarter conversion.\n- Macro context. Transformer and HVDC scarcity, gas equipment slot discipline, and AI/datacenter load growth are supportive. Onshore wind orders outside North America are mixed; management signaled potential 2026 onshore revenue decline if the softness persists.\n\nDriver 1: Wind equipment volume and implied pricing\nDefinition per context: wind equipment revenue, turbines delivered (units), delivered capacity (GW), and implied revenue per turbine.\n\nAnnual (history and forecast)\n- FY2020: n/a (pre-spin disclosure limits)\n- FY2021: n/a\n- FY2022: n/a\n- FY2023:\n  - Equipment revenue: 8,327M (sum of 10-Q | Segmental breakdown | Equipment | Wind for 2023Q1–Q4)\n  - Turbines delivered: 2,388 units (Others | KPI’s | Sales (in units) | Wind turbines for 2023Q1–Q4)\n  - Delivered capacity: 9.3 GW (Others | KPI’s | Sales (in units) | Wind turbines and repower(GW) for 2023Q1–Q4)\n  - Implied revenue per turbine: ~3.49M (Derived from above)\n- FY2024:\n  - Equipment revenue: 8,018M (10-K | Segmental breakdown | Equipment | Wind for 2024FY)\n  - Turbines delivered: 1,778 units (Others | KPI’s | Sales (in units) | Wind turbines for 2024FY)\n  - Delivered capacity: 7.8 GW (Others | KPI’s | Sales (in units) | Wind turbines and repower(GW) for 2024FY)\n  - Implied revenue per turbine: ~4.51M (Derived)\n- FY2025 (Forecast):\n  - Equipment revenue: 8,050M (Forecast;

Pricing/mix: disciplined; implied ASP stays ~4.5–5.0M/turbine (10-K/10-Q wind KPIs; management stance on price discipline).\n- Power services\n  - Mid-single-digit growth continues, supported by RPO expansion from 69.5B (2Q24) to 79.1B (2Q25) (Others | KPI’s | Backlog | Power order for 2024Q2; 2025Q2), steady outage cadence, and upgrade intensity (10-K, Power services).\n- Orders and RPO\n  - Orders: modest growth off 2024 base with 2H seasonality; Electrification captures HVDC/transformer programs; Wind intake selective. RPO: grows to ~130B at FY25 (from 119.0B FY24 and 128.7B at 2Q25) (Others | KPI’s | Backlog | Remaining performance obligations for 2024Q4; 10-Q, Jul 23, 2025).\n- Segment mix\n  - Electrification share continues to climb (backlog 27.5B in 2Q25) while Power remains largest; Wind share moderates near term, stabilizing with services/repower (Others | KPI’s | Backlog | Electrification for 2025Q2; 10-Q | Segmental breakdown).\n- FX\n  - Treated as a modest noise factor; 2025 net headwind assumed modest, then neutral thereafter (8-K | KPI’s | FX effect series).\n- Geography\n  - U.S. share trends up modestly with AI/data center load in Power and grid buildouts; non-U.S. remains majority but with flatter mix.\n\nCaveats and dependencies\n- Scope limits: Pre-spin historical disaggregation for 2020–2022 is limited in the extracted series; thus, several drivers have fewer than five years of history.\n- Quarterly geography not disclosed; segment mix percentages are shown as shares of the three reportable segments and exclude “Other/eliminations.”\n- Forecasts are not guidance; they reflect assumptions tied to:\n  - Backlog and orders trajectory (RPO 117.7B at 3Q24; 119.0B at 4Q24; 123.4B at 1Q25; 128.7B at 2Q25; 10-Q and KPI fields cited),\n  - Management commentary on wind onshore softness for 2026 and ongoing offshore backlog execution,\n  - Observable growth in Electrification backlog and Power services stability.\n- Offshore wind project timing/execution, tariffs ($300–$400M 2025 headwind noted in context), commodity and supply-chain constraints (transformers, castings/forgings) could shift quarterly conversion and mix.\n- FX assumptions are illustrative; sharp USD moves would alter the quarterly effects.\n\nNotes on sources (for the historical figures above)\n- Segment revenues and disaggregation: 10-Q/10-K | Segmental breakdown | Total and Disaggregates total revenues to external customers for sales of equipment and sales of services by segment (2023Q1–2025Q2; 2024FY).\n- Wind KPIs: Others | KPI’s | Sales (in units) | Wind turbines and Wind turbines and repower(GW) (2023–2025 to 2Q25).\n- Orders: Others | KPI’s | Total orders (2023FY, 2024FY, and quarters through 2Q25).\n- Backlog/RPO: Others | KPI’s | Backlog | Remaining performance obligations (2024Q4, 2025Q1) and 10-Q text (RPO 117.7B at 3Q24; 128.7B at 2Q25).\n- FX translation: 8-K | KPI’s | Organic revenue by segment | Total revenues | Less: foreign currency effect (2023–2Q25).\n- Geography: 10-K | Geographical breakdown | Revenue by geography (U.S., Total non-U.S., Non-U.S. Americas; 2024FY).

We provide FY 2023–FY 2024 actuals where available; earlier years are not used due to comparability (spin-related). Quarterly segment/type detail for 2024Q4 is not present in the provided context; where 3Q24 quarterly details existed, they were cited (Field: 10-Q, Oct 23, 2024). We explicitly flag any “not disclosed in context.”\n  - Segment sums vs consolidated: Quarterly and annual segment sums can differ from consolidated totals due to eliminations and “Other.” Segment and consolidated series are presented on their own bases. \n- Forecast method and anchors\n  - FY25 revenue modeled from 1H actuals using FY24 seasonality (Calc). Segment growth rates align to: Electrification high-SD/low-DD scaling; Power services-led growth with disciplined new-units; Wind flat in 2025 then −~12% in 2026 (management: 2026 onshore revenue −10–15%), then gradual recovery (Fields: 10-K/10-Q/press; Transcript_Sep2025_2026_Onshore_Revenue_-10–15%).\n  - Orders/backlog: 2025 orders guided “~$50B” (Field: Transcript_Sep2025_2025_Orders_~$50B). RPO trajectory approximates orders minus revenue, cross-checked to “backlog up ≥$13B” in 2025 (Field: Transcript_Sep2025_Backlog_Up_≥$13B_2025).\n  - FX: FY24 net −$6m; 1H25 −$63m; we assume FY25 ≈ −$75m net, then small thereafter (Field: 8-K | KPI’s | Organic revenue | Less: foreign currency effect 2024FY, 2025Q1–Q2).\n  - Wind units/GW: Use reported 2024FY and 1H25 datapoints, 3Q24 disclosure, then modest recovery in late-2025, a 2026 pullback, and gradual normalization thereafter (Field: Others | KPI’s | Orders | Wind turbines / turbines & repower(GW) 2024FY; 2025Q1–Q2; 10-Q Oct 2024 p.8).\n  - Gas turbine units: 2024FY 112; 1H25 85; we model ~175 for 2025 and ~160–170 thereafter in line with capacity discipline (~20 GW/yr cap) (Field: Others | KPI’s | Orders | Gas turbines; Transcript_Feb2025_Capacitizing_~20GW_NewUnit).\n- Dependency on context sources\n  - All historical numbers come from tags provided in your context. Projections are labeled (Calc) and are not company guidance.\n  - TAM references are used only to inform directional growth rates; the driver forecasts are framed in revenue and unit terms, not TAM dollars.\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver these as two simple tables (annual and quarterly) and share a spreadsheet with all driver series, including supporting reconciliations to consolidated revenue and sensitivity cases."

    "one": "Synthesis note\n- Backlog-led conversion underpins a multi-year uptrend. Electrification’s deep RPO coverage (~3.1x FY24 revenue) and Power’s services CSA base (~$61B service RPO at YE24) anchor visibility. Orders are running ahead of revenue (book-to-bill >1 in 2023–2024; 2025 orders guided/indicated at ~$50B vs. ~$37B revenue), implying continued RPO build.\n- Mix trends are constructive. Company-wide services continue to outgrow equipment modestly, while Electrification accelerates on HVDC/transformers/software. Wind is stabilizing: volume remains choppy, but price/mix and repower help; Offshore legacy backlog is burning down through 2026.\n- Macro catalysts. Structural load growth (data centers, electrification), grid modernization, and gas “higher-for-longer” support the forward cadence.

These estimates preserve fiscal totals and observed seasonality.\n- Forecast horizon and pattern:\n  - Electrification: growth anchored by ~3.1x backlog coverage at YE24; applied ~22–23% FY25 growth (consistent with 1H momentum), decelerating to mid/high-teens thereafter.\n  - Services: +5–6% annual growth, consistent with CSA/RPO depth and mix improvements.\n  - Wind: FY25 equipment revenue and segment revenue down low-to-mid single digits with lower H2; stabilization afterward; repower and price/mix provide support; Offshore legacy backlog burns down through 2026.\n  - Orders/RPO: 2025 orders ~50B (company commentary), RPO builds by ≥$13B; modest growth thereafter as Electrification and Power execute.\n  - Equipment vs services: services’ share edges up over time; modest (+~3%) equipment growth assumed.\n  - FX: treated as net-zero over the forecast horizon, acknowledging quarterly volatility.\n- Currency: All dollars are US$. Wind “GW” is a physical volume metric, not currency.\n- Dependencies and risks: Policy/permitting timelines (especially U.S. onshore wind), HVDC/offshore execution, tariff and supply-chain costs, and FX can shift quarterly cadence. Management has stated it will not add uneconomic Offshore backlog; assumptions reflect this discipline.\n- Alignment check: Forecasts are designed as a continuation of observed history (2023–1H25), consistent with backlog conversion, orders cadence, and management’s qualitative guidance in the provided context.",
    "two": "Below is a driver-by-driver forecast for GE Vernova (GEV) that extends the company’s reported history into FY0–FY4 and Q0–Q3, using only the revenue drivers given in context. Where the filings do not disclose a quarterly split for a specific datapoint, I flag it explicitly and avoid filling gaps with invented history. All forecasts are in US Dollars and reflect assumptions stated at the end.\n\nOptional synthesis note\n- Cross-driver themes: Services share is rising steadily, supported by the large Power installed base and Electrification’s scaling grid backlog. Segment mix remains anchored by Power and Electrification growth while Wind is in transition (onshore profitable and disciplined, offshore executed down). Orders and RPO are the strongest lead indicators, especially in Power and Electrification. FX is a secondary full-year driver but a meaningful quarterly swing factor.\n- Catalysts and macro: Electrification’s HVDC/transformer cycle and US load growth (AI/data centers) underpin Power equipment and services. Wind’s inflection is later-cycle (onshore pipeline into 2026–2027; offshore burn-down through ~2026). Tight OEM/EPC capacity supports pricing. TAM context (company anchor to ≥$435B by 2030) is consistent with mid-to-high single digit multi-year growth, led by grids and dispatchable power.\n\nDriver 1 — Equipment vs. Services Mix (total company)\n- What it is: Split of total revenues between sales of equipment and sales of services.\n\nAnnual history and forecast (USD millions)\n- FY2023 (actual): Equipment 18,258; Services 14,981; Total 33,239\n- FY2024 (actual): Equipment 18,952; Services 15,983; Total 34,935\n- FY2025 (FY0 forecast): Equipment 19,936; Services 17,328; Total 37,264\n- FY2026 (FY1 forecast): Equipment 21,272; Services 19,015; Total 40,287\n- FY2027 (FY2 forecast): Equipment 22,669; Services 20,841; Total 43,510\n- FY2028 (FY3 forecast): Equipment 23,831; Services 22,533; Total 46,364\n- FY2029 (FY4 forecast): Equipment 24,936; Services 24,247; Total 49,183\nNotes: 2023–2024 are reported. 2025–2029 totals tie to segment-mix forecasts below; services share is assumed to rise modestly each year (about +70 bps per year) given backlog and installed-base trends.\n\nQuarterly history and forecast (USD millions)\n- History (last four quarters):\n  - 2024Q3 (actual): Equipment 5,290; Services 3,620 (press release, 2024-10-23)\n  - 2024Q4: not disclosed at the company level (filings/press do not give a clean 4Q split); do not substitute\n  - 2025Q1 (actual): Equipment 4,197; Services 3,835\n  - 2025Q2 (actual): Equipment 4,894; Services 4,217\n- Forecast (Q0–Q3)\n  - 2025Q4 (Q0): Equipment ~5,965; Services ~5,102\n  - 2026Q1 (Q1): Equipment ~4,350; Services ~4,000\n  - 2026Q2 (Q2): Equipment ~5,060; Services ~4,430\n  - 2026Q3 (Q3): Equipment ~5,420; Services ~4,760\nNotes: 2024Q3, 2025Q1–Q2 are reported. 2025Q4–2026Q3 are modeled to align with the FY outlook and normal H2 seasonality (Q4 heavier).\n\nDriver 2 — Segment Mix (Power, Wind, Electrification total revenues)\n- What it is: Total segment revenues; the mix materially shapes earnings trajectory.\n\nAnnual history and forecast (USD millions)\n- FY2023 (actual): Power 17,293; Wind 9,815; Electrification 6,118; Total 33,239\n- FY2024 (actual): Power 18,127; Wind 9,701; Electrification 7,550; Total 34,935\n- FY2025 (FY0 forecast): Power 19,215; Wind 9,216; Electrification 8,834; Total 37,264\n- FY2026 (FY1 forecast): Power 20,175; Wind 9,953; Electrification 10,159; Total 40,287\n- FY2027 (FY2 forecast): Power 21,184; Wind 10,949; Electrification 11,378; Total 43,510\n- FY2028 (FY3 forecast): Power 22,243; Wind 11,605; Electrification 12,515; Total 46,364\n- FY2029 (FY4 forecast): Power 23,355; Wind 12,186; Electrification 13,642; Total 49,183\nAssumptions: 2025 Power mid-single-digit growth (~+6%); Electrification mid-to-high teens (~+17%); Wind down mid-single digits (~−5%).

Q0–Q3 are consistent with segment FY trajectories and typical seasonality (Power and Electrification skew to H2 on equipment; services steady with outage seasons).\n\nDriver 3 — Orders and Backlog (Leading Indicators)\n- What it is: Orders (equipment/services) and remaining performance obligations (RPO); primary lead indicators of future revenue.\n\nAnnual history and forecast (USD millions, end-FY RPO)\n- Total orders (actual/forecast):\n  - FY2023: 41,637\n  - FY2024: 44,107\n  - FY2025 (FY0 forecast): 50,000\n  - FY2026 (FY1 forecast): 52,000\n  - FY2027 (FY2 forecast): 55,000\n  - FY2028 (FY3 forecast): 58,000\n  - FY2029 (FY4 forecast): 60,000\n- RPO/Backlog (actual/forecast; end of period):\n  - 2024Q4 (actual): 119,023\n  - 2025Q4 (FY0 forecast): 132,000\n  - 2026Q4 (FY1 forecast): 140,000\n  - 2027Q4 (FY2 forecast): 148,000\n  - 2028Q4 (FY3 forecast): 155,000\n  - 2029Q4 (FY4 forecast): 160,000\nDrivers: 2024 orders +2.5B YoY, 2025 orders guided qualitatively to “~$50B” (management commentary). RPO grew to 123,438 in 2025Q1 from 119,023 at 2024Q4; segment snapshots show further increases by 2025Q2 in Power and Electrification.\n\nQuarterly history and forecast (USD millions)\n- History (last four quarters):\n  - 2024Q3: Total orders not disclosed explicitly; do not substitute\n  - 2024Q4 (actual): Total orders 13,200 (record quarter; press release 2025-01-22)\n  - 2025Q1 (actual): Total orders 10,152; RPO 123,438 (end of quarter)\n  - 2025Q2 (actual): Total orders 12,364; (total RPO not disclosed; segment RPO/backlogs rose further)\n- Forecast (Q0–Q3)\n  - 2025Q4 (Q0): Total orders ~13,500; RPO ~132,000 (end of FY)\n  - 2026Q1 (Q1): Total orders ~11,000\n  - 2026Q2 (Q2): Total orders ~12,000\n  - 2026Q3 (Q3): Total orders ~12,500\nNotes: Quarterly order phasing reflects grid awards lumpiness (Electrification) and seasonality in Power booking; the RPO trajectory is consistent with continued book-to-bill ≥1x in Electrification and ~1x consolidated across 2026.\n\nDriver 4 — Volume (Units and GW)\n- What it is: Physical delivery indicators that correlate with segment revenues (Power: gas turbines and GW; Wind: turbines and GW including repowers).\n\nAnnual history and forecast\n- Gas turbines delivered (units) and GW (actual/forecast):\n  - 2024 (actual): 75 units; 11.9 GW\n  - 2025 (FY0 forecast): 86 units; 13.0 GW\n  - 2026 (FY1 forecast): 95 units; 16.0 GW\n  - 2027 (FY2 forecast): 105 units; 20.0 GW\n  - 2028 (FY3 forecast): 110 units; 20.0 GW\n  - 2029 (FY4 forecast): 115 units; 20.0 GW\n  Rationale: Aligns with management’s plan to reach ~70–80 HDGTs annually starting 2H26 and ~20 GW annual shipments by 2027; gradual unit increases with stable GW thereafter reflect mix (H/F/aero) and capacity.\n\n- Wind turbines delivered (units) and GW (actual/forecast):\n  - 2024 (actual): 1,778 units; 7.8 GW\n  - 2025 (FY0 forecast): 1,730 units; 7.6 GW\n  - 2026 (FY1 forecast): 1,900 units; 8.5 GW\n  - 2027 (FY2 forecast): 2,100 units; 9.2 GW\n  - 2028 (FY3 forecast): 2,200 units; 9.5 GW\n  - 2029 (FY4 forecast): 2,300 units; 9.8 GW\n  Rationale: 2025 modestly down with selective onshore bidding and offshore run-off; rebound from 2026 as US onshore pipeline converts and offshore backlog completes.\n\nQuarterly history and forecast (units and GW)\n- History (last four quarters):\n  - 2024Q3 (actual):\n    - Gas: 18 units (company 10-Q)\n    - Wind: 515 units; 2.4 GW (company 10-Q)\n  - 2024Q4: not disclosed; do not substitute\n  - 2025Q1 (actual):\n    - Gas: 19 units\n    - Wind: 276 units\n  - 2025Q2 (actual):\n    - Gas: 21 units\n    - Wind: 351 units\n- Forecast (Q0–Q3)\n  - 2025Q4 (Q0):\n    - Gas: ~24 units; Wind: ~500 units; Wind GW ~2.2\n  - 2026Q1 (Q1):\n    - Gas: ~20 units; Wind: ~300 units\n  - 2026Q2 (Q2):\n    - Gas: ~22 units; Wind: ~360 units\n  - 2026Q3 (Q3):\n    - Gas: ~24 units; Wind: ~500 units; Wind GW ~2.4\nNotes: Quarterly wind GW complements units where disclosed; modeled quarters follow typical H2 skew and outage/installation seasons.\n\nDriver 5 — Foreign Exchange (FX)\n- What it is: Reported FX effect on revenue; generally a minor full-year driver, with quarterly swings.\n\nAnnual history and forecast (FX effect on total revenue, USD millions)\n- FY2023 (actual): +74\n- FY2024 (actual): −6\n- FY2025 (FY0 forecast): ~−50 (headwind; blended)\n- FY2026 (FY1 forecast): ~0\n- FY2027 (FY2 forecast): ~+50\n- FY2028 (FY3 forecast): ~0\n- FY2029 (FY4 forecast): ~0\n\nQuarterly history and forecast (USD millions)\n- History (last four quarters):\n  - 2024Q3: not disclosed; do not substitute\n  - 2024Q4: not disclosed; do not substitute\n  - 2025Q1 (actual): −129\n  - 2025Q2 (actual): +66\n- Forecast (Q0–Q3)\n  - 2025Q4 (Q0): ~0 to −25 (mild headwind)\n  - 2026Q1 (Q1): ~0\n  - 2026Q2 (Q2): ~0\n  - 2026Q3 (Q3): ~0\nNotes: FX is modeled to net close to zero over full years beyond FY25; quarterly noise remains possible.\n\nAssumptions and caveats\n- Scope and sources: Only the five drivers provided in your context are covered. All reported numbers are from GEV filings/press (e.g., 10-K/10-Q, 8-K/press) as cited in context; any forecast is my own, derived from those anchors.\n- Time coverage limits:\n  - Annual history: GEV’s standalone history begins 2023. I include 2023–2024 actuals; earlier years are not available as a standalone GEV reporting set.\n  - Quarterly history: I include the most recent quarters available in filings (2024Q3, 2025Q1, 2025Q2), plus 2024Q4 where explicitly disclosed. Where a quarterly split was not disclosed (e.g., company-level equipment/services in 4Q24; certain segment quarterly totals), I do not fabricate.\n- Key modeling assumptions:\n  - Segment revenue growth: FY2025 Power +6%, Electrification +17%, Wind −5%, consistent with management commentary (mid-single-digit Power growth; mid-to-high-teens Electrification; Wind down mid-single digits). 2026–2029 reflect sustained Power and Electrification growth and a Wind inflection as onshore pipeline converts (and offshore backlog completes by ~2026).\n  - Equipment vs services: Services share rises about 70 bps per year 2025–2029, in line with installed-base expansion and services orders strength.\n  - Orders and RPO: 2025 orders ~50B and RPO up ≥$13B are taken from management commentary; 2026–2029 assume continued growth with Electrification bookings and Power slotting at disciplined margins.\n  - Volume: Gas shipments rise toward the company’s ~20 GW/year target by 2027; Wind volumes are modestly down in 2025 and recover thereafter (U.S.-led onshore).\n  - FX: FY2025 modest headwind; neutral thereafter on a full-year basis (quarterly volatility persists).\n- Dependencies and risks:\n  - Electrification grid awards are lumpy; HVDC/switchgear timing can affect quarterly orders and revenue phasing.\n  - Power deliveries depend on OEM/EPC capacity and customer readiness; premium slot pricing helps margins but may shift quarterly timing.\n  - Wind remains the relative-risk area until offshore backlog is fully executed; onshore demand is policy/interest-rate sensitive and U.S. interconnection timing is a gating factor.\n  - FX assumptions are illustrative; macro currency moves could differ materially.\n- Alignment: Forecasts are a continuation of reported trajectories and consistent with order/RPO momentum, margin guidance, and the company’s disclosed capacity expansion/slotting plans.\n\nIf you’d like, I can deliver these drivers in a compact model workbook and add sensitivity cases (e.g., higher Electrification orders, slower Wind recovery, stronger USD) so you can toggle scenarios for FY2026–FY2029 and Q0–Q3."

All figures in US dollars (USD millions).\n- Organic growth scale: The organic growth series in filings is presented as proportions (e.g., 0.10 ≈ 10%). I use that interpretation for both history and forecasts.\n- Data availability: Annual series before listing are limited. Where annual organic growth was not disclosed, I use a FY2024 proxy (average of quarterly organic YoY). Older FYs may be “n/a” due to carve-out limitations.\n- Quarterly to annual linkages: Segment totals include intersegment elimination; consolidated totals reflect elimination. 2025H2 revenue forecasts explicitly subtract an average elimination ratio derived from 2025Q1–Q2 (-1.23%) to align segment and consolidated totals.\n- Equipment/services splits: 2025H2 quarterly splits apply the 2025H1 average services mix (~47%). From 2026 onward, I keep a ~47% services mix for simplicity; actual mix may drift with equipment timing and service attach.\n- Segment growth: 2025 quarterly segment forecasts extrapolate 2025H1 y/y changes into H2; FY2026–FY2029 apply differential CAGRs (Electrification 12%, Power 8%, Wind 7%) consistent with backlog momentum and management commentary on TAM/SAM. If wind policy/tariffs or offshore timing deviate, the Wind series could be higher/lower.\n- Orders and RPO: 2025 quarterly/annual orders are based on observed H1 y/y and applied to 2024 comps; RPO forecasts use a simple flow model (RPO(t) ≈ RPO(t-1) + Orders – Revenue + small positive adjustments). The “adjustment” term approximates CSA accruals and other non-order changes; actuals can differ due to contract modifications, FX, and timing.\n- FX/portfolio: Quarterly FX is volatile; the base case assumes reduced net FX noise for 2025H2–2026H1. Portfolio (acq./disp.) impacts are set to immaterial absent disclosed transactions.\n- Scope limits: No attempt is made to introduce new drivers beyond what the context specifies. Where disclosure is insufficient (older FYs), I label values as “n/a” and avoid backfilling with estimates.\n\nThis forecast intentionally continues current momentum: consolidated revenue growth stepping up in 2025 with strong equipment cadence and a rising services base; balanced quarterly seasonality similar to 2024; Electrification outperformance sustained; Power steady with annuity-like services; and Wind improving but still timing-sensitive. Orders and RPO remain the forward anchor, with FX and portfolio changes treated as noise unless or until the company discloses material shifts.",
    "two": "Optional synthesis note\n- Demand visibility is highest in Electrification and Power services. Electrification revenue growth is set to outpace the company average on the back of a rising backlog and debottlenecking, while Power services should continue to compound steadily with the growing installed base and higher utilization.\n- Wind equipment is improving off a low base in 1H25 but remains the most policy- and execution‑sensitive driver; we model a 2026 dip (consistent with onshore headwinds) and a gradual recovery thereafter.\n- Orders growth stays positive with services leading; backlog discipline and selectivity in Wind support quality of conversion.\n- FX remains a quarterly noise factor, modest on a full‑year basis. Geographic mix remains diversified; we model a gradual U.S. mix drift higher as North American grid and gas momentum accelerates.\n\nDriver 1: Services mix and installed base monetization (Power)\nMetric: Power services revenue (USD millions)\n\nAnnual\n- History (as available)\n  - 2023: 11,758\n  - 2024: 12,391\n- Forecast\n  - FY0 2025: 13,011\n  - FY1 2026: 13,792\n  - FY2 2027: 14,482\n  - FY3 2028: 15,131\n  - FY4 2029: 15,736\nAssumptions: +5% 2025 (1H25 +3% YoY and accelerating RPO), +6% 2026, then +5%/+4.5%/+4% as the installed base and upgrades compound; Power RPO growth through 2Q25 supports sustained services conversion.

    "one": "Synthesis (context and cross-driver themes)\n- Core setup: Services are compounding on a growing installed base (especially in Power), Electrification is in a multi-year up-cycle with rising backlog and longer lead times, and Wind volumes are stabilizing with gradual normalization and mix discipline. Orders remain >1x book-to-bill, sustaining backlog conversion.\n- Macro link: TAM glidepath to ≥$435B by 2030 (~8.6% CAGR) supports a mid-single to high-single-digit revenue runway, with Electrification likely outgrowing the company average and Power services anchoring cash flow.

we treat 2025Q3 as the first forecast quarter (Q0).\n  - Currency: All figures in US dollars.\n- Forecast method\n  - FY2025: Built from 2025H1 actuals, applying YoY uplift to H2 using 2024 seasonality and segment dynamics (Electrification > Power > Wind growth).\n  - FY2026–FY2029: Mid-single to high-single-digit growth aligned to backlog support and TAM glidepath, with services growing faster than equipment; Electrification outgrowing company average; Power services growing ~4.5%–5% p.a.; Wind volumes recovering gradually.\n  - Quarterly forecasts: YoY growth applied to prior-year comps; seasonally stronger Q4 assumed (equipment-heavy).\n- Book-to-bill and orders\n  - Orders growth assumed to modestly outpace revenue to maintain book-to-bill ~1.2x over the medium term. Equipment/services order mix gradually tilts toward services (~0.5 pp per year).\n- Wind volumes\n  - FY2025 units and GW assume a slight H2 uplift vs. 2024H2 (+~3% units, +~5% GW) with gradual annual recovery thereafter (+~4% units and +~5% GW CAGR through FY2029).\n- Dependencies and risks\n  - Execution on large Electrification projects (HVDC, grid stability) and Wind program discipline.\n  - Policy/permits and supply-chain conditions affecting timing (especially Wind).\n  - Mix variability can shift quarterly profiles (equipment-heavy quarters vs. services).\n- Consistency notes\n  - Segment totals may not sum exactly to consolidated totals due to Other/eliminations; forecasts preserve observed relationships.\n  - Forecasts are directional and anchored to disclosed trends (RPO growth, orders cadence, services outgrowth, Electrification momentum) rather than issuing company guidance.\n\nSources (selected)\n- Income statement: equipment/services revenue by quarter and year, FY2024 totals, 2025Q1–Q2 actuals.\n- Segment revenue: Power, Wind, Electrification by quarter and year (2023–2025Q2).\n- Power services revenue: quarterly/annual.\n- Wind volumes: turbines and GW by quarter and year (2023–2025Q2; 2023/2024 full-year levels).\n- Orders/RPO: total, equipment, services by quarter and year; RPO references support revenue visibility.",
    "two": "Synthesis note (what ties the drivers together)\n- Electrification is the structurally fastest grower, supported by a “seller’s market” in grid equipment and strong RPO/contract liabilities. Power remains resilient with a large services annuity and healthy new-unit demand tied to firming needs and data-center load. Wind is the near‑term drag, consistent with soft order intake and management’s commentary that 2026 wind revenue is down 10–15% versus 2025. Backlog conversion and services expansion are the common threads across drivers. Pricing discipline continues, while FX is modeled as broadly neutral beyond near-term quarterly noise.\n\nRevenue drivers from context and forecasts\nAll figures are US Dollars (USD, millions unless units noted). Historical data reflect GEV filings; 2023 full‑year figures are sums of quarterly disclosures. Forecasts are clearly labeled (E) and grounded in the context: 2025 full‑year revenue ~$37B (orders ~$50B vs. revenue ~$37B, Sep-2025 mgmt commentary), Electrification momentum, Power mid/high-single digit growth, and Wind softness with 2026 down 10–15% versus 2025. Where quarterly disclosures are not available (e.g., some 2024 quarter splits), quarterly forecasts use conservative seasonality assumptions based on recent cadence.\n\n1) Equipment vs. services revenue mix\nAnnual (history, then forecast)\n- 2020: n/a\n- 2021: n/a\n- 2022: n/a\n- 2023 (sum of quarters): Equipment 18,258;

Currency: USD.\n- Limited standalone history: GEV’s first complete standalone fiscal year is 2024. Where 2020–2022 annual data are “n/a,” the company did not report a comparable standalone series. Quarterly 2024 equipment/services and segment splits were not fully disclosed in the provided set; historical quarters are shown where available.\n- 2025 revenue anchor: Full-year 2025 total revenue modeled at ~$37,000 (orders ~$50B vs revenue ~$37B, management commentary, Sep-2025), with segment allocation consistent with H1 2025 cadence and Electrification outgrowth.\n- Segment growth glidepath (2026–2029): Power +7%, +6%, +5%, +5% (2026–2029); Electrification +18%, +14%, +11%, +9%; Wind -12.5% in 2026 (midpoint of -10% to -15% commentary), then +3%, +5%, +5%. This reflects current backlog, grid “seller’s market,” and wind orders softness.\n- Equipment/services mix: Services share rises gradually from ~47% in 2025 to ~50% in 2029, reflecting installed-base monetization and backlog conversion. Quarterly H2 2025 split uses a Q4‑heavier seasonality consistent with historical cadence.\n- Pricing vs FX: FX translation is shown explicitly (history and near-term forecast). Pricing effects are embedded within organic growth and segment forecasts; no separate pricing series is disclosed and thus not quantified independently.\n- Orders/RPO/contract liabilities: 2025 orders (~$50B) and backlog build (RPO up ≥$13B YTD per Sep‑2025 commentary) anchor the 2025E figures. Out‑years assume book‑to‑bill modestly above 1x in 2026–2027 and ~1.0–1.03x in 2028–2029. RPO and contract liabilities forecasts are directional and depend on project timing and milestone billings.\n- Quarterly availability: Where a “last four quarters” history is incomplete (e.g., segment and equipment/services splits for 2024Q3–Q4), forecasts are provided but historical entries are marked as not disclosed.\n- Uncertainties: Wind volume and revenue pacing remain policy and execution sensitive; tariffs could alter near-term pricing/mix; FX may deviate from modeled neutrality; timing of HVDC/grid project conversion can shift quarterly cadence."
